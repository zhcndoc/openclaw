  - You want the citable version of the trusted-gateway / untrusted-execution argument
  - You want to know whether OpenClaw's enterprise depth makes it heavyweight for personal use
title: "Why OpenClaw"
---

OpenClaw is an extensible, proactive, open-source AI agent that works everywhere you work. It exists because software is inverting: for decades you went to the computer, opened the app, clicked through its screens, and did the work yourself. An agent acts on your behalf instead, on your machine, in your messages, against your accounts.

That inversion is why agents feel like the beginning of something rather than another product cycle, and why they deserve more scrutiny than anything you have installed before: an assistant that acts for you holds credentials, reads mail, and runs commands on real computers. The architecture decides what it _can_ do long before any policy decides what it _may_.

The project is stewarded by the [OpenClaw Foundation](https://openclaw.org), an independent 501(c)(3) whose mission is to make AI personal, fun, and empowering for everyone: your agent, your machine, your rules. It is built on the observation that the open source projects that endure (Linux, Apache, Mozilla) endure because a neutral steward stands behind them.

The Foundation works with [donors and partners](https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw-foundation/), including Amazon, Atlassian, GitHub, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Red Hat, and Tencent, across more than thirty organizations. It has a full-time team, releases signed under its own identity, and Foundation-convened councils on agent identity, agent profiles, evals, and enterprise deployment. The aim is to be the Switzerland of AI: neutral ground for every model and every lab, and the most mature, battle-tested agent for anyone, individual or enterprise, to build on.

For an evaluation, governance is not decoration. It answers who controls the roadmap, who signs what you deploy, and what happens when any one vendor's incentives change.

Agent platforms commonly offer [channels](/channels), [tools](/tools), [memory](/concepts/memory), [skills](/tools/skills), [scheduling](/automation). A feature table does not establish the security model. The main distinctions are **where the trust boundary lies** and **whether policy is enforced in code or requested in the system prompt**.

A single trust envelope can put the agent loop, channel connections, credentials, and shell under one OS user. Wrapping that entire application in a VM isolates it from the host, but does not separate those components from each other.

The recurring comparison is [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/tree/6defe7eb6c462bb784d1f27f5afe7ca4b627fc70), whose [security policy](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/6defe7eb6c462bb784d1f27f5afe7ca4b627fc70/SECURITY.md) states:

> The only security boundary against an adversarial LLM is the operating system.

OpenClaw can separate a trusted [Gateway](/gateway) from untrusted, movable execution. Policy is enforced in code, and state is versioned and migrated, so a deployment is replaceable. This page compares configured architectures, not default security certifications: sandboxing is off by default in OpenClaw. The source review was refreshed on August 27, 2026 against [OpenClaw `7b624e9de25`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/7b624e9de25bc66c97166071c8d05f055d82ec54) and [Hermes Agent `6defe7eb6c`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/tree/6defe7eb6c462bb784d1f27f5afe7ca4b627fc70). These are development snapshots; check your installed version and configuration before relying on a capability.

A good harness spans the whole range: the same product runs as a personal assistant on one laptop and as a hardened team deployment, with configuration as the only difference. There is no enterprise edition. If you run OpenClaw for yourself, the defaults are tuned for you and none of this requires action. The properties below are phrased as an enterprise evaluation because that is the harshest audience, but every one of them protects a single operator the same way: credentials the agent never sees, deletion that sticks, upgrades that refuse to break state.

## What an enterprise harness has to prove

Seven testable properties:

1. **Separated trust boundary.** Execution moves into a sandbox, a node, or a throwaway cloud machine without standing Gateway credentials; scoped worker credentials have a separate lifecycle.
2. **Policy is code.** Denial is structural, not a request the model is asked to honor; approval paths fail closed.
3. **Authenticated access, bounded roles.** Inbound access is default-deny and authenticated; people hold bounded roles; the vendor states which boundaries are security and which are convenience.
4. **Secrets have owners.** Isolatable credential failures degrade their owners; ingress-auth and invalid-configuration failures stop startup.
5. **Versioned state, guarded upgrades.** State is schema-versioned with owned migrations; upgrades are guarded and delivered through release channels.
6. **Recorded provenance.** Memory, audit, and delivery use recorded facts, explicit retention policies, and documented deletion limits.
7. **Independent stewardship.** The license has no separate enterprise edition; releases are signed by an accountable identity; the security record is public.

## How OpenClaw answers

The short answers, with details and limits on the linked pages:

- **Isolation limits what compromised execution can reach.** Configured sandboxes, nodes, and cloud workers separate execution from Gateway authority; exposure still depends on tools, mounts, network policy, and scoped credentials. ([Trust boundary](/start/why-openclaw/the-trust-boundary))
- **Configured policy is enforced in code.** Tool availability and exec denial do not depend only on model compliance; commands requiring approval must satisfy the applicable binding rules. ([Policy as code](/start/why-openclaw/policy-as-code))
- **Access follows the configured admission policy.** Pairing-mode channels challenge unknown senders, and broader device scopes require approval; role ceilings and a deny-all default role require configuration. ([Identity and roles](/start/why-openclaw/identity-and-roles))
- **Protected credentials can stay out of model context.** Protected secret values use handles and supported egress substitution; agent-readable entries, host access, and permitted-service responses have separate exposure risks. ([Secrets](/start/why-openclaw/secrets))
- **Version checks guard upgrades.** Schemas are versioned, updaters check compatibility, and releases are immutable and signed. Version checks do not guarantee that every upgrade succeeds. ([Versioned state](/start/why-openclaw/versioned-state-guarded-upgrades))
- **Forgetting has explicit boundaries.** Attributable memories can be purged, and forgotten-session records prevent reingestion through participating paths; original transcripts, untracked writes, and external copies remain separate. ([Provenance](/start/why-openclaw/provenance))
- **The Foundation provides independent stewardship.** MIT under an independent 501(c)(3) foundation, with signed releases and public security advisories. Advisory counts are not a comparative safety score. ([Governance](#governance))

The [comparison table](/start/why-openclaw/openclaw-and-hermes-agent) condenses the source-verified contrast with Hermes. [What we do not claim](#what-we-do-not-claim) states the limits, starting with sandboxing being off by default.

## The vendor's harness, as a plugin

Agent harnesses are becoming model-specific: labs train and evaluate their models inside their own loops. OpenClaw treats those harnesses as first-class runtimes rather than API endpoints ([agent runtimes](/concepts/agent-runtimes)). The [Codex plugin](/plugins/codex-harness) drives Codex's own app-server loop — native thread resume, compaction, approvals, mid-turn steering, OpenClaw tools bridged into Codex turns, [computer use](/plugins/codex-computer-use) — the Copilot plugin runs the GitHub Copilot SDK's session loop, and the Anthropic plugin drives the installed Claude Code executable through its structured stdio protocol, while OpenClaw keeps ownership of channels, sessions, policy, and state. The choice stays with the operator, subject to supported routes, authentication, and request settings. [Runtime selection](/concepts/agent-runtimes#runtime-selection) can use a declared fallback to OpenClaw's built-in loop; inspect the completed runtime when exact harness ownership matters. Gateways that integrate these vendors at the API layer keep their own executor in charge; the vendor harness is at most an optional backend.

This embedding pattern comes from the vendors. OpenAI built the Codex app-server so partners could "embed the same harness in their own products" ([Unlocking the Codex harness](https://openai.com/index/unlocking-the-codex-harness/)) and [described its open-source harness and platform integrations](https://developers.openai.com/blog/codex-as-a-platform) in August 2026; Anthropic ships the [Claude Agent SDK](https://anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk) as the same harness that powers Claude Code. The relevant comparison is which native lifecycle and tool contracts an integration preserves, not whether it merely names the vendor's model.

Like other OpenClaw features, harnesses ship as plugins against a core that stays deliberately small. Channels, model providers, memory, voice, the Codex harness — all plugins behind documented [capability registration points](/plugins/architecture), with the boundary enforced by CI import guards, not convention. You can remove what you do not want (strip channels, disable memory, run a minimal surface, pin the allowed set with `plugins.allow`), and third parties can add what we did not build through the same [SDK contracts](/plugins/sdk-channel-plugins) — including whole message channels, which is how community plugins cover networks the core never touches. The ordinary plugin loader validates [manifests](/plugins/manifest) before importing plugin runtime code. Trusted bundled helpers can load separately after path validation.

The public plugin SDK publishes about 150 entrypoints, held under shrink-only surface budgets so growth is a conscious decision. Hermes also has a broad [Python plugin API](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/6defe7eb6c462bb784d1f27f5afe7ca4b627fc70/hermes_cli/plugins.py), including tools, platforms, context engines, memory, secret sources, and media providers, plus a [desktop plugin SDK](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/6defe7eb6c462bb784d1f27f5afe7ca4b627fc70/website/docs/developer-guide/desktop-plugin-sdk.md). Its seven consent capability IDs describe permission gates, not the size of that API.

[ClawHub](/clawhub) is OpenClaw's registry, with [publishing](/clawhub/publishing), moderation, [security audits](/clawhub/security-audits), and per-release trust verdicts consumed during installation. Hermes also distributes skills through tap repositories and maintains an MCP catalog. ClawHub shows skill scan status from VirusTotal, ClawScan, and static analysis, but a pending or stale scan can allow installation with a warning; installation is not proof that every scan completed. [`openclaw skills verify`](/cli/skills) retrieves ClawHub's verification envelope for the selected skill, using installed registry and version metadata by default; it does not hash current local files.

## Open standards

OpenClaw adopts the protocols the ecosystem is converging on. It is an [MCP client](/tools/mcp) (Streamable HTTP, SSE, and stdio transports, with OAuth) and an [MCP server](/cli/mcp), and plugins can [ship their own MCP servers and apps](/plugins/manifest/surfaces#mcp-server-reference). Other agents reach it through the Linux Foundation [A2A 1.0 protocol](/channels/a2a) — Agent Card discovery, authenticated JSON-RPC tasks, and outbound peer messaging — and editors connect over the [Agent Client Protocol](/cli/acp), which OpenClaw also uses to [host external harnesses](/tools/acp-agents). Agents render live [A2UI widgets](/web/dashboards) on session dashboards.

Skills follow the [AgentSkills spec](/tools/skills), plugin installs auto-detect [Agent Plugins, Codex, Claude, and Cursor bundle layouts](/plugins/bundles), and the Gateway can serve an [OpenAI-compatible API](/gateway/openai-http-api) (`/v1/chat/completions` with a documented function-tool subset, [`/v1/responses`](/gateway/openresponses-http-api), `/v1/models`, `/v1/embeddings`; disabled by default, `/v1/responses` separately enabled) so OpenAI clients can target the Gateway directly. Observability exports over [OpenTelemetry](/gateway/opentelemetry) and [Prometheus](/gateway/prometheus); gateways advertise via [Bonjour and DNS-SD](/gateway/bonjour); channels include native [Matrix](/channels/matrix), [IRC](/channels/irc), and [Nostr](/channels/nostr) protocol implementations; and releases ship with [npm provenance and verifiable artifact attestations](/reference/RELEASING).

## Working together

Most agent-assisted work today happens between one person and one terminal; others see the finished commits. A shared OpenClaw gateway makes the work itself observable. [Sessions](/concepts/session) carry an immutable creator, an assignable owner, and the people who actually prompted; the [Control UI](/web/control-ui) shows [who is viewing and typing](/concepts/presence) in real time (drafts stay ephemeral and never reach the model or the transcript), and the sidebar filters by owner or by "involving me" ([multi-user](/concepts/multi-user)). A conversation that starts in a channel can continue as a session the whole team can open, steer, and take over.

OpenClaw supplies exact `Co-authored-by` trailers for eligible shared-session participants with verified GitHub identity and **Git co-author credit** enabled, ordered by recorded contribution aggregates. Credit is on by default for verified accounts and can be disabled in Profile. The Gateway publication broker enforces that credit in its generated commits and pull requests; ordinary Git relies on the agent following the session's system prompt. When an external HTTPS session URL is available, broker-created pull requests end with a link to the team session ([user model](/concepts/user-model)), so a reviewer with access can read the conversation that produced the diff. Local coding sessions can be mirrored near-live to a team gateway with [Beam](/plugins/beam), and [cloud workers](/gateway/cloud-workers) put execution on disposable machines while the transcript stays in one shared place. [Portals](/gateway/portals) proxy an agent's development server into the operator's browser through the Gateway, and Cloud Worker Desktop streams a live VNC view of the worker — an authenticated loopback-only RFB server, reached through a single-use broker ticket over the worker's own outbound connection, never public ingress, with view-only filtering and single-controller arbitration. Hermes also provides visual observation: its desktop app [forwards remote development servers over SSH](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/6defe7eb6c462bb784d1f27f5afe7ca4b627fc70/apps/desktop/electron/preview-reach.ts), and its [Camofox integration can expose a browser VNC viewer](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/6defe7eb6c462bb784d1f27f5afe7ca4b627fc70/tools/browser_camofox.py#L154). Those are different transports and scopes from OpenClaw's Gateway-brokered worker desktop. OpenClaw is developed in shared sessions on the maintainers' own team gateway; the roles, attribution, and audit surfaces in [Identity and roles](/start/why-openclaw/identity-and-roles) and [Provenance](/start/why-openclaw/provenance) support that workflow. To set this up for your own team, follow [Team setup](/start/teams).

## Governance

The whole OpenClaw product is MIT-licensed, with no enterprise edition under a different license, and it is governed by the [OpenClaw Foundation](https://openclaw.org) introduced above. The Foundation's stewardship shows up in the architecture: providers are plugins, and no lab's model is privileged. Releases are signed and published under the Foundation identity.

The Foundation is funded by donations and sells nothing: no paid tier, no hosted service, no token. The only request an install makes to the Foundation by default is a version check, and [`update.checkOnStart: false`](/gateway/telemetry) turns it off; traffic to your configured model providers and channels goes to them, not to us.

Hermes is built by Nous Research, a venture-funded company listed in [Paradigm's portfolio](https://www.paradigm.xyz/portfolio); TechCrunch reported [a $75M round at a $1.5B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2026/07/13/hermes-agent-maker-nous-research-in-talks-for-new-funding-at-1-5b-valuation/) in July 2026. The same report describes paid Hermes tiers of $20 to $200 per month as the business model. The [Hermes README](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) presents Nous Portal, that subscription, on its first screen, and `hermes setup --portal` configures it. The [Nous Portal privacy policy](https://portal.nousresearch.com/privacy) states that it collects prompts, uploads, and outputs and may produce derivative datasets and models unless Privacy Mode is enabled. The self-hosted Hermes agent itself sends no telemetry.

We are not saying Hermes is worse engineering. We are saying the two projects answer to different people. Venture investors expect a return, and the reported plan for that return is paid Hermes tiers. OpenClaw's only obligation is to stay useful enough that people keep donating. Pick the incentive you want pointed at you.

Third parties invest in the architecture: NVIDIA's [NemoClaw](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-nemoclaw) distribution hardens OpenClaw with OpenShell kernel-level sandboxing, infrastructure vendors publish [production-hardening guides](https://nebius.com/blog/posts/openclaw-security) for it, and [academic security case studies](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.12644v1) analyze the architecture and catalog threats. Those publications describe their own dated snapshots, not certification of today's configuration.

OpenClaw [publishes repository security advisories](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories), with a written [trust model](/gateway/security), an [incident response plan](/security/incident-response), and security contributors from NVIDIA and Tencent. On August 27, 2026, the public repository advisory lists contained 647 OpenClaw advisories and [no Hermes advisories](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/security/advisories). Hermes has CVEs published through third-party CNAs. These counts describe disclosure records, not the number of currently exploitable defects or a comparative safety score.

## What we do not claim

- Sandboxing and exec approvals are off by default. Default OpenClaw is a trusted single-operator assistant. Hardening is deliberate configuration, and `openclaw security audit` will tell you when you have drifted from it.
- One gateway is one trust domain. Roles and session ownership are collaboration guardrails. Tenancy means one gateway cell per tenant, and fleet is still experimental.
- Native plugins run in-process and are not sandboxed. Mitigations are allow-lists, an install-policy hook, pinned versions, dependency locking, and CI-enforced SDK boundaries. Both OpenClaw and Hermes require trust in installed native plugins.
- Egress allowlisting covers cooperating traffic only. The [secret egress proxy](/gateway/secrets) gained an opt-in traffic allowlist for Gateway-hosted exec (August 2026) on top of its bypass-surviving sentinels, sandboxed execution defaults to kernel-enforced `network: "none"` or runs under the [OpenShell backend's](/gateway/openshell) default-deny policy allowlists, but raw sockets from unsandboxed host exec answer to an operator-supplied [proxy](/security/network-proxy) or host policy, not to OpenClaw. Allowlist proxies elsewhere have had published bypasses; the sentinel design assumes bypass instead of trying to prevent it.
- Promoted memories have no time-based retention bound. Provenance and [`openclaw memory forget`](/cli/memory) cover tracked artifacts; admission exclusions apply to dreaming ingestion and session backfill, not direct writes, hooks, or raw transcript indexing. Review [deletion limits](/concepts/memory-provenance#what-deletion-does-not-cover) separately. Turn taint covers network-sourced tool output; text arriving through non-network tools does not taint the turn.
- `gateway.roles` is present in the reviewed August 2026 source snapshot. Check your installed version before depending on it.

## The hardened setup

Each enterprise configuration item links to its reference:

- Sandbox on: `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: "all"` with the [`openshell`](/gateway/openshell) or [`docker`](/gateway/sandboxing) backend; `workspaceAccess: "ro"` unless the agent owns the workspace.
- Select [`guarded` or `workspace`](/gateway/permission-modes) per session; `full` requires `operator.admin`. Sessions without a mode, including managed worktree sessions, use configured tool/exec policy.
- Front the gateway with [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale) or an [identity-aware proxy](/gateway/trusted-proxy-auth); define [`gateway.roles`](/gateway/operator-scopes) with a deny-all default; leave DM policy on [pairing](/channels/pairing).
- Everything behind [SecretRefs](/gateway/secrets); run `openclaw secrets audit --check` against your config in CI.
- Enable [message auditing](/gateway/audit); export [OpenTelemetry](/gateway/opentelemetry) to your SIEM with operator-owned retention and monitoring for dropped data.
- Schedule [`openclaw security audit --deep`](/gateway/security/audit-checks) and alarm on its check IDs.

Then operate it as replaceable infrastructure: pin a channel, let [doctor](/cli/doctor) own migrations, restore [backups](/cli/backup) by verification, and redeploy instead of repairing deployments in place.
