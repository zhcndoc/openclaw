### State schema 17

Schema 17 adds the complete prepared-worker storage contract. The nullable
`worker_environments` columns `preparation_key`, `preparation_demand_at_ms`,
`preparation_expires_at_ms`, and `preparation_consumed_at_ms` form one constrained
tuple for one-use capacity. The separate nullable `last_activated_at_ms` column
stores successful activation time. Ready-pool admission writes the preparation
tuple; consuming that capacity and assigning a session placement share one
transaction. Successful placement activation records its demand time in the
same transaction. Consumption survives failed attachment, placement retirement,
and reopen, while terminal rows retain unexpired demand and uncertain cleanup.
Migration leaves all five values `NULL` on existing workers and does not infer
demand, activation, or unused capacity from historical rows.

Dedicated nodes register fixed build paths in the first-use
`node_worker_prepared_workspaces` table. It records the exact environment and
completed `preparation_key`, a required `cache_key` identifying compatible
project/runtime contents, and fixed workspace and HOME paths. Separate required
`source_manifest_ref` and `prepared_manifest_ref` digests identify the clean Git
baseline and completed setup tree. Initial binding verifies the completed tree;
replay preserves the bound session's edits. Binding records the session and
owner epoch once. Retirement keeps that binding until machine teardown, so
retired paths cannot be claimed by another session.

Registration creates the node-only table inside its existing synchronous write
transaction. An aborted registration rolls back that DDL, and a later attempt
can create it again. Ordinary database open and migration leave the table
absent. Per-agent schemas and native companion tables do not change; native
clients can continue validating and reading their existing owned tables at
state schema 17 without performing migrations.

Startup and `openclaw doctor --fix` apply the schema-16 Skill Workshop migration
before the prepared-worker migration when opening a schema-15 database. A
schema-16 database receives only the prepared-worker migration. The tuple
constraint belongs to the last added column, so migration scans existing
environments once and preserves the table instead of rebuilding it. Leases,
credentials, placements, inference turns, unknown additive data, and uncertain
cleanup remain intact. No provider operation runs in the migration transaction.

Migration content and its version facts commit together; failure rolls back all
database changes from that attempt. Both published markers normally advance to
17 in that transaction. When an older updater still owns trailing ledger reads,
the existing [version-publication deferral](/reference/database-schemas/versioning#schema-bumps-and-older-updaters)
keeps the published markers at their earlier version and records applied content
17 separately. Reopening does not repeat that content migration. Workshop
directory relocation runs afterward, outside the schema transaction.

Before upgrading, stop older writers and create a verified, WAL-aware backup.
Builds supporting state schema 16 or earlier refuse the published schema 17.
To roll back, complete cloud cleanup with a compatible build, stop all writers,
then restore the pre-upgrade backup into a separate state directory. Restoring
does not retain changes made after that backup. Do not lower either version
marker or erase a consumed binding. Unresolved provider cleanup can continue
incurring charges until deletion is confirmed.

### State schema 16

Schema 16 removes `workspace_dir` and `claim_released_time` from
`skill_workshop_proposals`. It also removes `workspace_dir` and
`idx_skill_workshop_collection_reviews_workspace_time` from collection review
history and adds `owner_agent_id` plus its owner/time index. Proposal rows remain intact. A proposal whose claim a
collection review had released becomes `stale` with a status reason, so the
skill path it once created stays user-owned and Doctor never relocates it.

Skill Workshop ownership is now the physical
`<state-dir>/agents/<agentId>/agent/workshop-skills` directory. Startup and `openclaw doctor --fix`
drop the retired columns and index in the shared schema transaction. Both then
run the same migration to relocate applied legacy Workshop creates to the
inferred owner agent and retarget eligible pending creates. Conflicts and ambiguous ownership become
stale proposals and leave the legacy directories unchanged. Review history rows
map to a unique owner agent when possible; otherwise the schema migration discards them as
cache-class state.

If a database reports schema 16 but still has recognized schema-15 Workshop
columns, update preflight identifies the pending migration and Doctor runs it
before rebuilding canonical indexes. Proposal-only legacy columns are handled
the same way. The repair preserves attributable review rows and unrelated
indexes; unrecognized column sets or dependencies on retired columns still
refuse and roll back the transaction.

Skill-only workspace relocation uses the existing `migration_runs` and
`migration_sources` tables to save pre-move directory identity, file hashes,
and the workspace attestation timestamp. After relocation, only matching
attestation-only state is retired; setup state, path aliases, and newer
attestations remain intact. Interrupted migrations reuse the saved pre-move
facts rather than inferring them from an empty directory. Workspace reset
removes pending workspace-scoped receipts. No additional schema version or
table is required.

### State schema 15

Schema 15 removes `target_agent_id` and `target_session_id` from `current_conversation_bindings`. The target index uses the complete `target_session_key` and remains non-unique: several conversations may point at the same destination. This lets plugin-owned targets persist without inventing an OpenClaw agent owner. Channel/account isolation, plugin approvals, binding identifiers, target keys, JSON metadata, expiry, and detach behavior are unchanged.

Startup and `openclaw doctor --fix` run the migration in the existing exclusive write transaction. They remove only the two projections and replace the target index, preserving all other row values. A dependent trigger, index, or failed schema check rolls the transaction back; migration does not discard an unknown dependency to force the upgrade. Column removal rewrites the binding table, so upgrade cost scales with its size.

Stop older writers and create a verified, WAL-aware backup before upgrading. Builds supporting shared-state schema 14 or earlier refuse the migrated database. To return to an older build, restore that pre-upgrade backup into a separate state directory; do not lower the version markers or reconstruct an agent projection. See [Downgrade](/install/updating#downgrade) for the general recovery contract.

### State schema 13

Schema 13 makes `cron_jobs.job_json`, `cron_jobs.state_json`, and `subagent_runs.payload_json` the canonical records. Physical columns remain only where production queries, ordering, or runtime-only updates require them. Cron jobs shrink from 75 columns to 15, and subagent runs shrink from 59 columns to six. Migration preserves failure-destination fields explicitly configured as undefined by encoding them as JSON `null`; it also normalizes legacy run-status aliases into `state_json` before removing the redundant projections.

The shared-state `auth_profile_stores` and `auth_profile_state` singletons move into `config_machine_state` under `authProfiles.store` and `authProfiles.state`; per-agent auth tables remain unchanged. Because these rows contain credentials, secret-redacted Git backups omit the `authProfiles.` machine-state prefix.

### State schema 11

Schema 11 removes the `skill_lifecycle` and `skill_workshop_proposal_origin_runs` tables. Archived-skill lifecycle state is discarded during the upgrade: previously archived Workshop skills return to the active collection, where weekly collection review judges them by content. The origin-run rows were a never-read projection; canonical proposal provenance stays in `skill_workshop_proposals.record_json`. Recorded skill usage and collection-review state are preserved.

### State schema 9

Schema 9 stores an `agent_databases.path` value relative to the state directory when the registered agent database is inside that directory. During migration, a foreign default-layout row is re-anchored to the in-root counterpart when that file exists. It is deleted only when the same agent already holds its in-root registration, because dual default-layout registrations cannot produce a valid combined session list. Otherwise, the absolute row is preserved, so genuine external registrations are never deleted. This keeps a copied state directory self-contained without dropping supported external database paths.
