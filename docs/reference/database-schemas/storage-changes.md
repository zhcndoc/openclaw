## Preparing for another database backend

SQLite remains the supported runtime store. Preparation for PostgreSQL should
improve the existing store owners and their tests before adding a driver or
configuration option. The initial target is remote persistence for one Gateway;
multiple active Gateways would require a separate ownership and coordination
design. A shared database alone does not make process-local writer queues,
session lifecycles, or host-owned leases safe across Gateway instances.

### Keep operations at the owning store

Callers should request domain operations, such as claiming a cron run or
appending a transcript report, from the store that owns the invariant. That
owner selects and decodes rows, validates current authority, commits changes,
and publishes the result. Avoid exposing a generic SQL callback to application
code or adding an asynchronous wrapper around an existing asynchronous facade.
The plugin KV API already has asynchronous methods over its SQLite owner.

Use Kysely for ordinary queries and mutations. The current
`getNodeSqliteKysely` facade compiles queries; `executeSqliteQuerySync` runs them
on the supplied `node:sqlite` connection. Calling Kysely's asynchronous
`execute` method on that facade is an error. Query compilation with another
dialect can identify syntax coupling, but does not prove driver behavior,
isolation, or database compatibility.

Task and flow stores keep row codecs and SQLite operations in connection-bound
kernels. Their existing facades retain global connection acquisition, cache and
close behavior, and write transaction admission. Compound subagent and cron
operations call the kernels on their already-admitted connection. Task status
classification stays with the pure record types, so decoding does not load
provider or plugin runtime ownership. Kernels and their transaction callbacks
remain synchronous. The asynchronous task and flow read facade runs these read
kernels in the shared-state worker.

The host captures the database path, state environment, and current admission
before awaited work. The shared worker owns its canonical connection and schema
opening, with Gateway schema authority delegated by its live coordinator owner.
Classified database errors survive transport, and canonical close joins worker
operations and native cleanup. Cold registry restoration and runtime-configuration
preparation still retain their existing main-thread behavior.

The optional `tasks.async.managedFlows` creation and revision mutations use the
same row kernels in the shared worker, with fresh owner, managed-mode, and
revision checks inside write admission. The admitted operation retains its actor
through the durable result and worker-backed projection reconciliation, including
during orderly shutdown. Delayed results cannot overwrite newer synchronous
writes or refreshes. Reconciliation failures leave the flow projection dirty and
preserve the durable mutation result without replaying the write.

Synchronous callers keep their existing transaction behavior. Native cancellation,
child-task linkage, and compound task/subagent completion retain their existing
owners until their complete persistence and lifecycle boundaries move together.

SQLite worker transport preserves complete result values. Results within the
64 MiB inline reply budget keep their existing reply path; larger results are
serialized once and transferred in 8 MiB frames. The original operation retains
its worker until the complete result and cleanup are acknowledged, including
during shutdown. Framing does not paginate or repeat the database query, truncate
results, or change request and queue budgets. Callers still materialize their
complete result in memory.

Worker execute inputs also use bounded frames when necessary. Queued commands
retain their full serialized-byte charge, up to the existing 64 MiB aggregate
budget. Larger commands require immediate admission to an idle worker and reserve
a 32 MiB transport window through settlement. Otherwise, admission returns the
existing overload error without queuing the value or executing any part of it.
Only complete validated input reaches the backend. The transport queue remains
bounded; an active complete input or result still requires its materialized memory.

Acquire a connection once for an operation and pass that exact connection
through its transactional helpers. SQLite write callbacks remain synchronous:
finish asynchronous planning first, then reread authoritative rows after write
admission. Publish live session changes and other dependent effects only after
the durable write succeeds. A future network-backed owner must preserve that
ordering while awaiting its driver.

Board operations, board inventory reads, and widget document reads expose asynchronous
contracts. Gateway callers await persistence before publishing board changes or replies.
Writes carry the caller's current-authority assertion into the synchronous SQLite
transaction. HTML widget capability actions and protected publication run in the store's immediate
continuation after its authoritative read and current ticket, session, and grant checks.
Database ownership is released before awaiting external work; no Promise handoff separates
the final authorization from its use. SQLite execution remains synchronous inside the
store, with existing revision, grant, and transaction semantics.

MCP App pinning retains its existing source-interaction checks. A delayed adapter must
revalidate that source authority at its actual write admission; checking view registration
alone cannot replace the supported asynchronous interaction policy.

Backup outcome recording and freshness reads expose asynchronous operations from
the shared-state owner. Archive, SQLite snapshot, and Git backup commands await
recording before reporting completion; a recording failure remains a warning and
does not change the backup result. Status and Doctor await freshness before
formatting it. These operations still execute synchronous SQLite internally;
they retain the existing insertion-and-pruning transaction, 200-row limit, and
non-creating freshness reads.

Explicit session deletion, lifecycle-artifact cleanup, and history disk-budget
eviction prepare their plans inside the session writer queue. When the parent database handle is cold, its
existing asynchronous admission owner runs the full integrity and foreign-key
checks in a read-only child, moving those full checks off the main thread while
retaining that queue position. A supplied caller guard is rechecked before the open
resumes into index repair, schema work, or registration, and before that caller
uses the admitted handle. Coalesced callers retain their own guards. History
eviction also uses this admission when reopening after archive materialization,
then rereads candidate protection before preparing reclamation.

After archive preparation, session deletion rereads its target before admitting
the final reclamation worker. A missing or changed target returns the existing
entry-mismatch result without starting that worker, while preserving archives
already committed by the deletion. Admitted workers still recheck the target
and current authority inside their deletion transaction.

Prepared session-store updates, entry replacements, and lifecycle upserts use
the same admission for cold snapshot reads and actual commits, retaining their
existing writer position. Warm update callbacks remain direct. Result-only
no-op commits do not reopen a disposed handle. Native deletion and archive
preparation still run outside the writer; the subsequent commit rechecks its
native owner's authority after any awaited admission.

Session reclamation keeps its deletion transaction on a worker connection.
The worker opens its database under the session writer, then releases that writer
while full integrity and foreign-key checks run on the same connection. Unrelated
session writes can continue during those checks. It reacquires the writer and
revalidates current authority before index repair, schema work, or deletion.
The connection and lease remain owned throughout admission; refusal unwinds that
owner, and final writer admission remains held until the worker exits.

Disk-budget cleanup rechecks protection after archive materialization. A candidate
already excluded by that fresh protection set is canceled before worker admission
and is not counted as reclaimed. After releasing its lifecycle holds, cleanup
remeasures physical usage before considering another candidate, so space freed by
a peer does not cause unnecessary eviction. Every admitted worker still performs
the full integrity, foreign-key, and current-owner checks described here.

Archive publication and cascading deletion remain atomic. Before COMMIT, the
worker publishes its authorization request in shared memory and waits for the
parent's current owner check. Synchronous writers service that request at the shared
SQLite transaction boundary between short lock-admission attempts, in the reclamation
owner's captured async context. This includes session entries, delivery records, and
first-use board and Goal schema transactions. Registration uses the open connection's
native database location, so other connections and reopened handles share admission.
Only admission is retried; transaction callbacks and mutations are never replayed.
The original lock-admission deadline is retained. After granting approval,
the parent synchronously joins transaction settlement before allowing owner retirement;
that mandatory join cannot be abandoned at the append deadline.

Periodic incremental vacuum uses the same write-admission boundary, so it can
service reclamation approval before taking the writer lock. Its 512-page limit
is unchanged; passive checkpoints remain outside the write transaction.

Reclamation page maintenance uses a PASSIVE checkpoint and at most 512 pages of
incremental vacuum per pass. PASSIVE does not wait for readers, but does not cap
the number of WAL frames copied. Before pruning retained archives, disk-budget
enforcement drains the initially observed free pages in units of at most 512,
yields between units, and reacquires the database owner after each yield. It
preserves physical checkpointing before measuring pressure, so unreclaimed pages
do not cause unnecessary archive deletion. Full logical deletion with resumable
physical cleanup remains a separate design; existing deletion visibility and rollback
semantics are unchanged.

Queued archive pruning prepares cold connections through the same asynchronous
admission owner while retaining its existing writer section. Each page-drain
pass keeps its checkpoints, freelist reads, and bounded vacuum in one synchronous
phase on the admitted connection. Archive-row and unpublished-name reads follow
validation. After removing a derived archive file, pruning reacquires before the
canonical row-deletion transaction; an acquisition failure propagates without
deleting that recovery row.

Usage-cache rollup writes, pruning, and refresh-lock changes use the same async
agent-database admission. A cold mutation waits for the existing integrity worker;
its compare-and-set transaction remains synchronous on the admitted connection.
Refresh completion and cleanup await persistence. Operations capture their resolved
database path before admission, and refresh-lock release retains that path and its
original environment when the caller's directory or environment changes. Doctor reports rejected
pruning operations before continuing to the next agent. Read-only cache snapshots
retain their existing synchronous owner and do not create missing databases.

### Preserve the data and concurrency contracts

An adapter must make these contracts explicit and verify them against a real
database:

| Contract           | Required behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Store identity     | Keep global and per-agent ownership, incognito lifetime, quarantine, and disposal explicit. Filesystem paths currently participate in admission and registry identity; replacing a path with a connection string is not sufficient. |
| Read consistency   | Define whether each operation needs one snapshot or a fresh authoritative reread. Keep ordered, bounded queries and batch enrichment inside that consistency boundary.                                                              |
| Conditional writes | Preserve exact revision, session generation, writer claim, and lease-owner predicates. A stale or refused mutation must not publish a success result or alter live state.                                                           |
| Canonical payloads | Preserve serialized transcript and record text where byte identity, replay, or exact JSON comparison is part of the contract. Keep derived query projections separate.                                                              |
| Scalar decoding    | Decode driver values at the store boundary, including counts, integer ranges, nullable booleans, timestamps, JSON, and binary bytes. Match TypeScript declarations to observed driver values.                                       |
| Failure and retry  | Define which failures permit retry of the whole operation. Keep external effects outside a retried transaction, and revalidate authority after awaited work.                                                                        |

Kysely's TypeScript types do not convert driver results; the driver determines
runtime values. See [Kysely data types](https://kysely.dev/docs/recipes/data-types).
PostgreSQL transactions must use one acquired client, and its default Read
Committed isolation can give successive statements different snapshots. An
adapter therefore needs operation-specific isolation and retry decisions, not
a mechanical replacement of `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. See
[node-postgres transactions](https://node-postgres.com/features/transactions)
and [PostgreSQL isolation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html).

Do not automatically convert canonical JSON text to `jsonb`: PostgreSQL's
`jsonb` representation changes whitespace, object-key order, and duplicate-key
handling. A searchable `jsonb` projection would need an explicit design and
migration decision. See [PostgreSQL JSON types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html).

### Keep engine-specific capabilities owned

SQLite FTS5/BM25, vector tables, JSON table-valued queries, attached shadow
databases, WAL maintenance, integrity checks, and backup operations remain
SQLite capabilities. Keep their implementation behind the memory or database
lifecycle owner. A future backend must supply equivalent product behavior or
an explicit capability boundary; a second SQL dialect alone cannot replace
these features. Schema, retention, migration, and multi-host changes still use
the review checkpoint below.

## Review checkpoint for material changes

An explicit maintainer repair-and-land request covers internal scheduling,
database admission, and lifecycle implementation decisions. The implementer
owns design selection, risk assessment, and verification. Describe the design
and its evidence in the PR; do not require a separate approval for each
implementation decision within that scope.

Before changing public contracts, schemas, durability, retention, or permissions,
open or link a maintainer discussion and record acceptance of the design. A
schema-version bump always needs acceptance, but keeping the numeric version
unchanged does not exempt a change to these contracts:

- a table, dedicated database, durable projection, persisted cache, index, or other schema representation
- which data is canonical, derived, reconstructible, retained, deleted, exported, or visible after restart
- user-visible persistence semantics, including a second interpretation of existing durable data
- upgrade, downgrade, rollback, retention, compaction, or corruption-recovery contracts
- durability, reader consistency, or permission boundaries

Internal transaction boundaries, writer admission, locking, and lifecycle
mechanics are engineering decisions within an authorized repair when they
preserve those contracts. Prove FIFO ordering, current authority after awaited
work, integrity checks, publication fencing, and settlement of write-capable
work. Assess performance and storage costs as part of that verification.

When separate acceptance is required, the discussion should identify the owning store and lifecycle, the problem being solved, alternatives that avoid new persistence, canonical versus derived data, schema and upgrade/downgrade behavior, retention and deletion behavior, concurrency and recovery invariants, performance/storage impact, rollback plan, and validation limits. The implementing PR must link that accepted decision.

The checkpoint normally does not apply to a read-only query that preserves existing semantics, a bounded query-plan improvement with no material write/disk tradeoff, routine maintenance of an existing approved schema, or tests, generated baselines, and documentation that only follow an already accepted design. A mechanical migration or repair still links the decision that approved its persistent contract.

For an urgent data-loss, security, or recovery fix, a maintainer may authorize a narrowly scoped exception before implementation. The appropriate public or private review record must capture the reason, temporary scope, rollback and validation plan, and any follow-up needed for the full design decision. The exception accelerates the design record; it does not waive review before merge.

## Preflight a target release

Before activating or rolling back a release, run that target release's CLI against one explicit copied state database:

```bash
openclaw database preflight <copied-state.sqlite> --json
```

The command does not read the default state directory or mutate the supplied file. It opens the supplied consolidated file as immutable/read-only, compares the target release's own schema contract, and reports one status:

- `exact`: the copied database matches the target release's runtime schema. Feature-local tables that are intentionally absent until first use do not require repair.
- `startup-repairable`: the numeric version matches and a runtime-owned additive difference remains; startup needs a write to converge the shape.
- `migration-required`: the database is older than the target release.
- `incompatible`: the database is newer, or its same-version shape has blocking drift such as an unexpected column.
- `indeterminate`: the file, integrity metadata, or ownership metadata could not be verified.

JSON output is identified by `schema: "openclaw.state-schema-preflight.v1"`.

Use a SQLite online backup or another WAL-aware snapshot produced while the source is safely coordinated. The resulting preflight input must be one consolidated file with no sibling `-wal`, `-shm`, or `-journal`; sidecars make the result `indeterminate`. Do not copy only the main `.sqlite` file from an active WAL database. Preflight the exact runtime that will be activated; a package version or numeric schema version alone does not prove same-version shape compatibility.

Diagnostic paths that prepare their own private read-only snapshots use the size-derived child-process budget described under [Integrity checks](/reference/database-schemas#integrity-checks).

### Preflight an explicit agent copy

Runtimes that provide the agent reader also support:

```bash
openclaw database preflight-agent <copied-agent.sqlite> --agent-id main --json
```

Use the exact canonical agent ID and a canonical regular-file path. This command
validates integrity, both schema version markers, schema shape, and agent ownership
through that release's maintenance reader, without creating, registering, migrating,
or repairing any store. The supplied file must be consolidated with no WAL, SHM,
or journal siblings. JSON uses `openclaw.agent-schema-preflight.v1`; only `exact`
is compatibility proof. Other outcomes exit nonzero and require no writes.

Shared-state preflight cannot validate agent databases. Older retained payloads
without `preflight-agent` remain unsupported; installing a newer CLI elsewhere
does not make those payloads compatible. Runtime/package identity and serving
health are separate checks from database compatibility. A successful read-only
preflight does not authorize checkpoint replay or replacement of live databases.
