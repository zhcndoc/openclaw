## Evidence to keep

Keep the `Full Release Validation` summary as the release-level index. It links
child run ids and includes slowest-job tables. Classify failures as product,
harness/tooling/provenance, infrastructure/credential, or wrapper. Only a
confirmed product failure changes the Code SHA. Use one diagnosis, one fix when
needed, and one narrow retry, then reassess; do not automatically rerun `all`.
Narrow evidence is not publish authorization by itself.

Read the **advisory** entries in `release-ci-summary` alongside Release Decision.
The manifest records each selected Windows/macOS cross-OS lane's advisory
classification and actual conclusion; an advisory failure can coexist with a
passing release decision. Keep its diagnostic artifacts for follow-up rather
than reporting that lane as passed.

For a regular release, record Code SHA and Release SHA even when they are the
same commit. In that case, retain the successful full validation parent and
its exact prepared publication artifacts for both roles. For a later
changelog-only Release SHA using evidence reuse, also record the reuse policy,
complete changed-path set, green Code SHA parent run, and Release SHA parent
run. For extended-stable, record the canonical branch, exact release SHA,
fresh parent run id and attempt, workflow ref, every child run, and any
frozen-target compatibility repair or intentional omission.

Useful artifacts:

- `release-package-under-test` from `OpenClaw Release Checks`
- Docker release-path artifacts under `.artifacts/docker-tests/`
- Package Acceptance `package-under-test` and Docker acceptance artifacts
- Cross-OS release-check artifacts for each OS and suite
- QA parity, runtime parity, and selected Matrix, Buzz, Telegram, Discord,
  WhatsApp, or Slack artifacts
