What happens when an update fails, and the subcommands that finish the job. Part of the [`openclaw update`](/cli/update) reference.

## Recover a failed update

After a failed interactive update or repair, OpenClaw finishes cleanup and offers
**Diagnose update failure**, **Report update failure**, or **Exit**. Reporting
previews the sanitized issue body and requires separate confirmation.

Unexpected exceptions retain the known update mode, resolved target, failed step,
and any recorded recovery outcome. Reports include a bounded, redacted error code
or name and first message line through the same diagnostics as failed commands;
unrecognized private text and stack traces are excluded from the public preview.

Choosing **Diagnose update failure** opens [Triage](/cli/triage), which starts the
first directly launchable coding agent on `PATH`, in this order: Claude Code,
Codex, OpenCode, then Pi. It passes the captured update failure directly and leaves
fresh Doctor checks and diagnostics collection to the agent, so a broken installation does
not delay the handoff. The agent keeps its existing authentication, sandbox, and
approval settings.

The agent starts in the operator's original working directory, or their OS home
if that directory is no longer accessible. The failed installation's resolved
state, config, and default workspace paths remain pinned for the repair.

A verified rollback leaves the previous generation running. The interactive menu
selects **Exit** by default; declining or cancelling keeps the failed update's
nonzero exit status. After a verified rollback, `--json`, `--yes`, non-interactive,
and managed-service handoff runs do not prompt or collect automatic diagnostics.

For failures without a verified rollback, updates using `--yes`, `--json`, or a
non-interactive session (including piped input or output) collect diagnostics
and print handoff commands without starting an external coding agent. Eligible
failures can start [post-failure triage](/install/updating#unattended-repair-on-your-own-inference)
on configured inference after update ownership and service compensation settle. With `--json`, triage output goes to stderr so stdout retains
the original update result. Diagnostic collection failures never hide the update
failure.

For a background or Control UI failure, use the installation-specific command
printed on the Gateway host. Printed commands use PowerShell on Windows and
POSIX shells on macOS, Linux, and WSL. When running triage manually, keep the same
profile and state/config overrides:

```bash
openclaw triage
openclaw triage --agent codex
```

Use `openclaw triage --non-interactive` to collect diagnostics without starting
an agent. Add `--update-result <path>` to include a saved update-failure artifact.

Validation failures leave the serving Gateway untouched. If stopping the managed
service unloads it and then fails before activation, OpenClaw attempts to restore
the verified original runtime after rechecking service ownership. After activation, a
failed verification can [restore the previous package](/cli/update/how-updates-run#validation-and-activation)
when database schemas are unchanged and the config file still matches the
candidate’s activation Doctor output. Preserve migrated state and
history; replacing the code alone cannot undo a migration. The original
failed update still exits nonzero after the agent finishes, even if the repair
succeeds.

Dry runs and commands rejected by the initial argument, external-supervisor,
state-store ownership, handoff identity, or immutable-config checks do not
collect diagnostics or start an agent. Once those checks pass, failed metadata,
schema, runtime, and managed-service checks use the failure actions above even
when installation is blocked. This includes an update that cannot safely stop
its parent Gateway process. Diagnosis preserves that refusal: it does not stop the
Gateway, retry the update, or bypass safety checks. See
[Update troubleshooting](/install/update-troubleshooting).

### Retained updater runtime

An update can retain its running code in an `openclaw-update-runtime-*` directory
beside the installation or in the system temporary directory. The updater settles
its workers and removes that directory after success, failure, an exception, or
`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, including failures while reporting the outcome. If a worker
cannot settle or removal fails, it records `Runtime retained at <path>: <reason>`
and leaves cleanup available to Doctor. A cleanup warning does not replace the
original update outcome.

Retention copies plugin manifests and files inspected by plugin safety checks,
so retaining the updater does not make the checkout's plugins fail hardlink
validation. Other runtime files remain hardlinked when supported.

These lifecycle and copying changes apply when the installed updater supports
them; installing a newer candidate cannot change the updater already running.
After that updater exits, run the newer `openclaw doctor --fix` from the original
checkout to locate its sibling runtime directories. Doctor also checks known
temporary directories, including the managed service's `TMPDIR`. Recognized
runtime projections are disposable; Doctor removes them when no worker still
uses them. If ownership or process liveness cannot be verified, Doctor preserves
the directory and reports the reason.

## Candidate Doctor stack overflow

Chat-triggered updates to 2026.9.6 can fail with `authority-check-failed: Maximum
call stack size exceeded`, sometimes preceded by `Update history reconciliation
could not complete`. This is a candidate Doctor authority-check defect; it can
happen on the first update, without migrated state or earlier failed runs.
The corrective candidate can run through the installed updater with retained
history intact. Running the older installation's standalone Doctor cannot fix
code in the candidate package.

There is no supported command to reset retained update history. `update repair`
finishes interrupted finalization, and `update cleanup` retires eligible recovery
originals; neither clears the run ledger. Keep history and backups rather than
deleting database rows to work around this failure.

## `update repair`

Rerun update finalization after the core package already changed but later
repair work did not finish cleanly. This is the supported recovery path when
`openclaw update` installed the new core package but post-core plugin sync,
managed npm plugin metadata, registry refresh, or doctor repair did not
converge.

```bash
openclaw update repair
openclaw update repair --channel beta
openclaw update repair --json
openclaw update repair --accept-capabilities
```

If an older updater publishes the new core but then reports
`update-executor-settlement-failed` with `Parent executor is suspended for its candidate.`,
wait for that updater to exit and run `openclaw update repair --yes --json` from
the updated installation, preserving its profile and state/config overrides.
This finishes Doctor and post-core convergence through a fresh owner. Check the
repair result before restarting an already stopped Gateway through its service
owner. Updating the candidate cannot change the older updater already in memory.

When a managed Gateway was already stopped before standalone repair, repair leaves
it offline and warns that you must run `openclaw gateway start` to bring it online.
If its service definition points to a different installation, repair instead reports
the installation repair command. These maintenance warnings also appear in
`postUpdate.doctor.warnings`; otherwise successful finalization reports
`status: "warning"` and exits successfully.

Untouched, identityless 2026.9.2-era update admissions heal automatically after
more than 24 hours. Gateway startup, `openclaw update status`, and `openclaw status`
retain the row as an abandoned failure with reason `legacy-driver-expired` and an
advisory to run `openclaw update` to retry. The Control UI refreshes the Gateway's
recovery classification before refusing a suspended config write, so an expired
orphan does not keep settings or provider sign-in blocked. Live updates and
pending recovery remain protected. No explicit repair is needed for this shape.

`update repair` first inspects stale update history. When the installed Gateway
generation is healthy and the only remaining problem is an inactive ledger row,
repair records `failed` / `abandoned` and exits successfully without Doctor,
maintenance, or a service stop. `openclaw status` and the Control UI then report the abandoned run as reconciled, without a failure warning or retry prompt; its historical failure record remains intact. It also acknowledges a Gateway-reconciled row
once within 30 minutes of reconciliation. Later repair invocations use full
finalization, so historical recovery cannot suppress plugin convergence.
Successful repair acknowledges every outstanding abandoned run in Doctor's
latest 100 history records, regardless of age or whether a newer update exists.
The original failed outcome remains recorded, including when its target build
is unknown; Doctor stops repeating the repair instruction after acknowledgement.
Explicit recovery does not wait 30 minutes when every recorded updater process
is provably dead (its PID is gone or its process-start identity has changed).
Identityless rows and runs with an unrecorded adopter still require more than
30 minutes of inactivity; a recorded live or uninspectable driver blocks
abandonment recovery.
JSON output identifies reconciled run IDs in
`reconciledRuns`, with `status: "ok"`, `mode: "repair"`, and `restart: false`.

Repair also acknowledges an untouched package installation whose update was
refused because its package-manager owner was unknown, once the installed
version meets or exceeds the resolved target. This includes older updaters that
incorrectly recorded that refusal as a failed update. The original refusal
detail stays in history; repair clears the failure prompt without Doctor
maintenance or a service restart. Runs that reached installation or finalization
still require normal repair.

Fresh Doctor children run with the existing external service-repair policy
because the updater owns service changes. They preserve an operator's
`OPENCLAW_SERVICE_REPAIR_POLICY=external` selection and retain Gateway/state
coordinators and agent-database lease checks. An external deployment owner still
owns stopping and restarting its Gateway.

Automatic repair finishes its embedded agent turn and releases that turn's database
and process resources before asking the update owner to run Doctor or update repair.
This prevents the repair agent's own credential writes from blocking maintenance.
Other live agent leases still block repair. Maintenance preserves the original
Gateway activation intent, including `--no-restart` and intentional stops. A
successful maintenance command alone does not verify the original symptom.

Repair invoked within the owning update can continue when its inherited run ID
and live process identity match that owner. Standalone repair records the same
continuation for its new run and passes that run ID to its Doctor children.
The repair parent uses Doctor's maintenance lifecycle to stop the owned Gateway,
then releases its database locks before running the Doctor children. The children
repair state without stopping or restarting the service. The parent restores and
verifies the same service after convergence, including when a Doctor child fails.
An already stopped service stays stopped. Service ownership and the invoking
run are revalidated before every native operation. A restoration failure names
the cause and the commands to inspect and restart the Gateway. Normal update
finalization continues to leave activation with its outer updater.

If Doctor reports that the update parent must stop the managed Gateway, wait
for that update to exit, then run `openclaw gateway stop` and retry
`openclaw update repair` from an independent shell with the same profile and
state/config overrides. On macOS, stop unloads the LaunchAgent and verifies that
its process exited. A still-loaded service or surviving PID after a successful
stop is a service shutdown failure. If stop cannot unload the service, use the
exact `launchctl bootout` command printed in the refusal from the owning user's
logged-in macOS GUI session.

An unrelated update whose driver is live or cannot be inspected still blocks
repair, even after a long period without activity. Manual `doctor --fix` also
refuses to stop a service while that update is active. The refusal identifies the
owning run, phase, driver PID, host, start and last-activity times and ages, and observed liveness (`alive` or
`not observed`). Wait for that update to finish, or stop the named driver on its
host and rerun `openclaw update repair` after it exits. Elapsed inactivity alone
does not authorize taking over a live updater.

Explicit channel or capability changes and known incomplete post-core work use
full finalization. Recorded activation, restart, verification, or finalization steps require
that convergence even if the Gateway has already reconciled the run. Repair
checks newer failed post-core history as well as active rows, including older
finalization attempts with an empty failure reason; an older stale row cannot
hide unfinished work from a newer update. If the bounded history inspection is
incomplete, repair also uses full finalization. The parent parks its owned service
before Doctor enters maintenance; a Doctor child cannot take service activation
from an update parent.
Successful full finalization then reconciles the selected stale rows and acknowledges
unacknowledged abandoned outcomes from the 100 most recent history rows captured
at repair admission. Those outcomes need not be the latest run or less than
30 minutes old; the time limit applies only to skipping full finalization.
Additional historical outcomes require full finalization, even when the latest
row qualifies for the lightweight repair. Historical failures and their details
remain intact; acknowledgment clears their Doctor repair prompts, not their failed
status. Rows outside the captured history window and new runs admitted during
repair are not acknowledged by that invocation.
Failed convergence leaves the selected rows intact. If any selected run resumes
before reconciliation, the whole selection is preserved. Full finalization JSON
includes `reconciledRuns` when rows were selected for recovery, listing the IDs
newly acknowledged by that invocation, including already-terminal abandoned rows.
Successful convergence with nonfatal warnings also acknowledges those rows.
Deferred maintenance preserves the selected history and pending migration obligations.

For full finalization, `update repair` runs `openclaw doctor --fix`, reloads the repaired config and
install records, syncs tracked plugins for the active update channel, updates
managed npm plugin installs, repairs missing configured plugin payloads,
refreshes the plugin registry, and writes converged install-record metadata.
Configured runtime plugins whose versions follow OpenClaw are checked against
the newly installed core during post-update repair, even when the updater process
started on the previous version.
It does not install a new core package or request update activation. The repair
parent restores a service it stopped for maintenance, as described above.
Human output ends with a finalization result that distinguishes completion,
completion with warnings, and failure.

When repair finds a configured npm plugin payload but cannot recover its install
record, it reinstalls from the selected registry source, using the active channel
or exact version pin. This requires registry access; if verification fails, repair
preserves the existing payload and does not publish a new install record.
Registry verification and any required capability review finish before the
repaired install record is published.

When a bundled plugin moves to an external package, failed relocation reports
that the replacement payload was not installed and preserves the underlying error.
Resolve that error before retrying with `openclaw update repair`.
Doctor and update repair reinstall configured payloads with missing package files
or a reported missing runtime entry;
an empty directory is not a successful installation. Rollback removes empty
managed npm projects after staged files are cleaned up. Doctor preserves external
companion packages and their install records even when a source checkout also
contains a bundled-discovery copy of the same plugin. Repair diagnostics must identify the recorded
package root; a broken same-ID source copy does not trigger replacement of a
healthy managed package.

With `--json`, stdout contains one JSON document. Doctor panels and other
diagnostics go to stderr, so stdout can be parsed directly. Plugin-only
availability, installation, or load failures appear in
`postUpdate.plugins.warnings`; finalization reports `status: "warning"` and exits
successfully when required checks pass. Doctor maintenance admission refusals
also finish with a warning when no data is at risk. Repair restores any service
it stopped, leaves migrations pending, and names the next repair action. Errors
after repair writes begin, a live or unverified Gateway, unreadable state, active migration writes, unsettled
cleanup, invalid configuration, and failed required readiness checks still exit nonzero.

Recorded pending-migration warnings stop appearing after the migration owner
records completion. Unrelated warnings and later or reintroduced obligations
remain visible; the original update history is preserved.

After post-update or finalization work fails and its child processes settle,
OpenClaw probes the installed Gateway using the normal startup and readiness
budget. Update history and failure reports record the observed serving version
and readiness, including for a foreground Gateway. A failed finalization step
can therefore report **verified serving** while retaining its original failure
and repair guidance. The observation does not restart the Gateway or grant
maintenance authority. Failed probes retain their specific diagnostic; a
Gateway that is still starting keeps that outcome instead of being restarted.
If command cleanup remains uncertain, the run stays open and retains its recovery
artifacts instead of publishing completion or starting another repair.

Doctor repair uses the same enabled-plugin and default-check selection as
ordinary Doctor lint. Opt-in checks, including the managed Codex version probe,
do not run during routine finalization. Explicit candidate checks still run
when requested with `doctor --lint --only codex/managed-app-server`.
The version probe has a five-second deadline, terminates its process group
where supported, and bounds output draining when a descendant retains a pipe.
A timed-out probe cannot be accepted merely because its direct child exited
successfully. Nonfatal Doctor warnings appear in `postUpdate.doctor.warnings`;
finalization reports `status: "warning"` and exits successfully when no other
step fails. Codex runtime readiness remains owned by its plugin after restart.

Finalization (including the supervisor-facing `update finalize` command) records
phase starts and finishes immediately on stderr and in the update run ledger.
Preflight admission, config validation, config backup, and core completion-cache
budgets scale with the shared SQLite database and its sidecars, with a five-minute
startup allowance and conservative disk throughput. Repair Doctor and its enclosing
convergence phase have no automatic wall-clock deadline. Post-plugin config and
readiness checks share a budget derived from the existing shared and discovered
agent database families after Doctor finishes, including WAL growth. Plugin
updates retain the command owner's 20-minute allowance; missing-plugin repairs
retain their installer defaults. The serial plugin phase and
outer finalizer process add no competing default deadline. An explicit `--timeout`
still overrides each phase and its child commands.

A phase deadline produces exit code 1 and JSON with `status: "failed"`,
`stuckPhase`, `elapsedMs`, `error`, and the existing `phaseTimings` array. The
finalizer cancels the phase, fences further writes, and waits up to the same
budget for its work to settle. Repair restores and verifies the Gateway it
stopped before reporting the failure and exiting. Service custody acquisition
and restoration retain their own native-operation budgets outside phase
cancellation. The ledger records a warning naming the timed-out phase and budget.
Preserve the phase diagnostic when reporting a stalled update.

When a fresh Doctor ran in the timed-out phase, `doctorOutput` includes its
`phase` (`pre-plugin` or `post-plugin`) and separate `stdout` and `stderr`
diagnostics. Each stream reports `receivedBytes`, `lastOutputAgeMs` (`null` when
silent), and a redacted `excerpt` capped at 256 UTF-8 bytes. The failed phase's
ledger detail and stderr retain the same excerpts before exit. Capture is limited
to 64 KiB per stream; exceeding that cap replaces the text with
`omitted: "capture-limit"`. An incomplete private key or a redaction error also
omits the stream text. A recent output age indicates output receipt; it does not
prove that a migration advanced. Output and heartbeats do not extend the phase
deadline. These diagnostics do not establish that every descendant has stopped,
and must not be used as rollback authorization.

Shared CLI disposers have individual five-second deadlines. Failure diagnostics
and any interactive recovery finish before the ten-second exit grace starts.
If the finalizer remains alive after that grace, stderr and the ledger record
active resource types and unsettled disposer names, then the process exits with
its recorded outcome. A retained handle cannot withhold the supervisor's result
indefinitely.
Both stall diagnostics also include `childProcesses`: up to eight descendant
processes with `pid`, `parentPid`, and an executable name (`command`). Arguments,
environment values, and executable paths are omitted. `childProcessesTruncated`
indicates omitted entries; `childProcessInspection: "unavailable"` means the
process list could not be read. A null `command` means that process's executable
name was unavailable. Inspection runs only after a stall and adds at
most one second to the exit bound. Phase-failure JSON includes the same fields.
Preserve these diagnostics and the phase receipts when reporting a blocked child.
Completion-cache refresh remains best effort when its child can be stopped within
the phase budget. A phase that exceeds its overall deadline still fails finalization.

Plugin artifacts that require capability consent are not installed without an
interactive review or explicit `--accept-capabilities`. `--yes` alone does not
accept capability changes, and JSON mode does not prompt. An unresolved review
preserves the previous plugin payload and appears in `postUpdate.plugins.warnings`
with a `PLUGIN_CAPABILITY_CONSENT_REQUIRED` outcome. When required checks pass,
`openclaw update` can complete the core update and requested Gateway restart with
`status: "ok"`; `update repair` reports `status: "warning"` without requesting
update activation. Both commands exit successfully. This also applies when a
bundled plugin moves to an external package or a missing configured plugin has
no install record yet; the unreviewed replacement is not installed. Automatic repair can
report a deferred replacement as a notice when a usable, enabled artifact remains
installed; that retained artifact still undergoes payload validation.

If the core package has already changed, run `openclaw update repair` in an
interactive terminal to review plugin capabilities. After reviewing the changes,
automation can use `openclaw update repair --accept-capabilities`. Acceptance
applies to each artifact's recomputed declared surface during this invocation;
it does not approve future capability additions.

### Skipped legacy audit recovery

When a legacy audit raw archive changed other than by append, Doctor preserves it
beside itself with a `.quarantined-<date>-<id>` suffix. The warning names the
quarantined path and explains the expected append-only growth and observed change.
An empty raw archive without a checkpoint is also quarantined when its sanitized
companion still contains history. Doctor keeps the sanitized records and existing
SQLite rows, continues later repairs, and does not repeat the warning on subsequent
runs. Quarantine does not import the changed bytes or delete the archive or backups.
Quarantined raw archives remain local and are excluded from portable backups;
sanitized companions and retained SQLite audit history are backed up normally.

Doctor can leave other legacy audit sources in place when a raw archive has no
checkpoint and begins with ambiguous whitespace, or cannot obtain another durable
raw-archive checkpoint. These conditions produce
a `skipped` migration receipt with a warning. Other repairs continue, and update
finalization can complete with warnings. An unsafe recovery failure, such as an
interrupted archive that cannot be restored, still stops Doctor.

Preserve the reported source, its sanitized companion (for example,
`logs/config-audit.jsonl.migrated` beside `logs/config-audit.jsonl.migrated.raw`),
and any recovery journals or backups. Follow [backup guidance](/install/backups)
before attempting recovery, and include the warning and archive filenames when
requesting help. Do not delete or rewrite archives or checkpoints to suppress
the warning.

Warnings for sources left in place repeat on later Doctor or `openclaw update repair`
runs until the archive is resolved. Successful finalization does not mean this historical audit
data was imported. There is currently no supported sanitized-only import when
the raw archive is unusable: accepting the companion as a recovery source needs
an explicit reconciliation procedure that preserves duplicate events, retained
history, and checkpoint evidence.

## `update cleanup`

Retire migration recovery originals after you have verified that the upgrade and
session history work. Start with a preview, which can run while the Gateway is
active:

```bash
openclaw update cleanup --dry-run
openclaw --profile work update cleanup --dry-run --json
```

Cleanup targets the selected profile and `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` / `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`
overrides. It displays that state directory and does not redirect to a managed
service. Confirm the displayed directory is the installation you intend to clean.
`--dry-run` reads only configuration and recovery metadata, without opening
databases, taking a maintenance lock, loading plugins, or creating state.
Candidate bytes still require identity verification; historical artifacts are
listed separately as requiring verification. Protected and blocked artifacts
include reason codes.

Before applying, stop the Gateway for that same profile/state directory and wait
for other SQLite maintenance commands to finish. Stop database readers too,
including watchers that repeatedly run `openclaw sessions --all-agents --json`,
and keep them stopped until cleanup exits. Read-only SQLite connections can
create or change WAL/SHM sidecars, invalidating cleanup's destination check even
when session content is unchanged. If cleanup reports `Recovery destination
database changed; preview cleanup again.`, stop those readers, preview again,
and retry. Cleanup requires exclusive offline state ownership and never stops
or restarts a service itself.

<Warning>
Cleanup permanently removes the selected rollback originals, including branches
and metadata intentionally removed by a verified repair. Doctor restore cannot
recreate them afterward. Keep them, or preserve an independent backup containing
them, if you still need that rollback path. Current SQLite history stays in place.
</Warning>

```bash
openclaw update cleanup
openclaw update cleanup --yes --json
```

Interactive confirmation defaults to **No**. JSON mode never prompts or grants
consent; unattended deletion requires `--yes`. Consent does not override
ownership, file identity, or dependency checks. Applicable flags (`--dry-run`,
`--yes`, and `--json`) work before or after `cleanup`; update-only flags
`--channel`, `--tag`, `--timeout`, `--no-restart`, and `--accept-capabilities`
are rejected.

Only owner-recorded recovery artifacts with complete import evidence are
eligible. Unknown or unimported history, malformed inputs, trajectories,
forensic corrupt databases, operator backups, and unmanifested artifacts stay
protected. Old manifests are verified offline where possible; missing evidence
is a reason to retain an artifact. Cleanup has no automatic expiration policy.
Private package, command-shim, and Git runtime backups remain owned by the update
transaction and are outside this migration cleanup. An interrupted entry in update
history does not block cleanup of otherwise eligible migration archives.

The JSON result contains `stateDir`, `status`, `artifacts`, and `totals`. Each
artifact reports its path, run ids, logical bytes, outcome, and reason. Totals
separate candidates, verification-required, protected, blocked, and removed
bytes. Removal failures exit nonzero. Keep the recovery manifests and rerun
cleanup to finish recorded interrupted work; a retry does not delete a recreated
file. Removed logical bytes do not promise
equivalent physical space reclamation on cloned or snapshotted filesystems.
When a path cannot be inspected, its logical size comes from recorded artifact
metadata when available. Cleanup records durable intent before removal and uses
exclusive no-copy publication. Failures are reported; retries reconcile file
operations that already completed. Manifest files are synchronized before removal;
parent directories are synchronized where supported. Windows does not provide the
same parent-directory durability guarantee.

Doctor restore reports intentionally disposed originals and pending cleanup
explicitly. Neither update nor cleanup creates an automatic full-state backup;
these recovery originals are **not a full pre-upgrade backup**. See
[Before updating: create a verified backup](/install/updating#before-updating-create-a-verified-backup)
for backup coverage and [Doctor recovery](/cli/doctor#session-sqlite-migration)
for restoring retained originals.
