  - You need the meaning of a doctor flag or a flag combination rule

This page covers how to invoke `openclaw doctor`: the supported postures, ready-to-run
examples, and every option the command accepts.

If a plugin fails to load during Doctor, the report includes an error finding
with the plugin ID, source path, and error. `ENOSPC` failures name the disk-space
cause. Standalone `doctor --non-interactive` exits `1` for these failures and
reports that Doctor finished with plugin load errors. When an updater invokes
Doctor, the same failures remain recorded warnings so an otherwise safe update
can continue; rerun Doctor after resolving the reported cause.

## Postures

Doctor supports these postures:

| Posture                   | Command                                   | Behavior                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Guided checks             | `openclaw doctor`                         | Interactive health flow; can copy legacy config and apply automatic state migrations. |
| Advisory JSON             | `openclaw doctor --json`                  | Read-only findings; exits successfully after producing a report.                      |
| Repair                    | `openclaw doctor --fix`                   | Applies supported repairs, using prompts unless non-interactive repair is safe.       |
| Lint                      | `openclaw doctor --lint [--json]`         | Read-only findings with threshold-based exit codes for CI gates.                      |
| Shared SQLite maintenance | `openclaw doctor --state-sqlite compact`  | Explicitly checkpoints, compacts, and verifies the canonical shared state DB.         |
| Session SQLite tools      | `openclaw doctor --session-sqlite <mode>` | Inspects or maintains SQLite sessions and explicitly imports legacy history.          |

Use `openclaw doctor --json` when an operator or script wants the advisory Doctor report as JSON. It exits successfully after producing a report; inspect `ok` and `findings` for health state. Use explicit `openclaw doctor --lint --json` when CI should exit nonzero for findings at the selected severity threshold. Prefer `--fix` when a human operator wants Doctor to edit config or state.

For read-only diagnosis, use `--lint` or bare `--json`. Ordinary `doctor`, including `doctor --non-interactive`, can copy legacy config and migrate state even without `--fix`. `--non-interactive` suppresses prompts, not writes.

When ordinary `doctor` asks **Apply recommended config repairs now?**, it checks
that the selected root config file still matches the source of that proposal.
If its contents or selected path changed before the write, Doctor preserves the newer file,
leaves the pending config fixes unwritten, and exits with an error. Rerun
`openclaw doctor` to review an updated proposal.

If saving succeeds but later processing fails, Doctor stops with an error, names
the file that was written, and reports whether the write was rolled back. When it was not rolled
back or recovery could not be confirmed, inspect that file and the active config
before rerunning Doctor.

If the shared state database uses a newer schema, Doctor refuses before offering
an interactive update because update admission also needs that database. Run
Doctor from the OpenClaw install that wrote the state, or another compatible
build. A readable shared database still permits an interactive source update
when agent databases use newer schemas; if the update does not take over,
Doctor checks all database schemas again before diagnostics or repair. See
[Database schemas](/reference/database-schemas).

After an exec-approval format upgrade, Doctor reports older generated approvals
that are no longer active because they were not tied to a working directory.
`openclaw doctor --fix` removes those inactive generated entries and leaves
manual allowlist rules unchanged. Rerun affected workflows and choose
**Always allow here** to renew trust for the intended directory. The normal
`openclaw update` finalization runs this safe repair automatically.

Explicit repair stops the matching managed Gateway and checks Gateway, state,
and agent-database ownership before taking read-only schema snapshots. It
excludes other processes during repair, then restarts the same service once
and verifies readiness. It preserves the service definition except for
[eligible installation drift](/cli/doctor/recovery#gateway-service-recovery) in a
previously running service, reconciled through the native installer. Automatic
refresh covers installation-only drift; additional native settings, operator edits,
or uncertain inspection still require interactive confirmation. Services
confirmed offline before maintenance keep their definitions and stop state; use
the reported profile-aware `openclaw gateway install --force` command to reconcile
them (installation may start the service). On Linux, it also
restores a previously running service if systemd unloads the stopped unit during
repair; a changed service definition or manager still blocks restart. A loaded, enabled
macOS job between respawns is not offline: Doctor stops it before repair and
resumes it afterward. Run repair from a shell outside the Gateway process tree. For externally supervised or unmatched installations, stop
and start the Gateway through its owning supervisor.

During [automatic triage](/cli/triage#automatic-failure-handoff), repair can run
against an offline target when schema and maintenance locks permit it. If repair
needs to stop the managed Gateway, Doctor refuses inside its automatic fixing
subtree because that stop would cancel recovery. Use read-only diagnosis or safe
offline artifact repair followed by an atomic `openclaw gateway restart`, or ask
an independent operator to run Doctor from a shell outside triage.

Read-only database snapshots and initial integrity scans have a 30-second
execution limit per database. A timeout names the database and asks you to stop
its Gateway service and other OpenClaw processes before retrying. If all writers
are stopped, inspect storage performance and the reported database; a timeout
does not prove corruption.

`openclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive` applies the supported migrations that
block Gateway startup without prompting, including shared-state audit schema,
legacy workspace setup, legacy session stores, and exec approvals. Malformed or
conflicting input is retained and requires the manual action in the diagnostic.
The updater uses this repair path before accepting the installed target.

Update-time Doctor runs startup-required repairs before optional inspections.
On large fleets it can defer auth and model diagnostics, plugin inspection,
skills and workspace metadata, session-snapshot cleanup, and advisory lint to
reserve time for required repairs and update validation. Each deferred check
appears as an `update-inspection-deferred` warning in Doctor output and the
update outcome, with the reason and remaining inspection allowance. A deferred
check did not pass or fail; it was not run.

Run `openclaw doctor --fix` after activation to complete those checks and review
optional repairs. An ordinary Doctor run does not retain the update's inspection
limit. Required session, database, workspace-state, and exec-approval readiness
checks still run during the update. Project-clone inspection, SQLite database-size
advice, and workspace backup and memory suggestions retain their standalone scope.

This maintenance window also applies when repair ultimately finds no changes.
Runs without `--fix`, `--repair`, or `--yes` do not enter maintenance.
Custom state directories remain runtime-only and do not adopt a native service.

`--force` alone does not select repair mode: `openclaw doctor --force` remains
guided and still requires interactive consent before an eligible service rewrite.
With `--fix`, `--repair`, or `--yes`, it allows aggressive config/state repairs
with the same installation-drift exception above. Force does not bypass service
ownership, write-access, or interactive-only confirmation requirements.

<Warning>
  `doctor --fix` follows explicitly configured workspace and store paths, including
  paths outside `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`. Setting `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` and
  `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` to a copy does not redirect those paths. Before rehearsing
  repairs on copied state, copy the external workspaces and stores too, then rewrite
  their paths in the copied config to point to the copies. Otherwise, Doctor can
  modify the originals.
</Warning>

During an update, Doctor respects the updater's service activation policy.
If the running Gateway has an old version/build or cannot load its WebSocket
handler after package replacement, Doctor stops that stale instance through
the verified service manager and confirms its process and listener are gone.
It retains service custody while running offline repairs, including legacy session
imports, then restarts the service and verifies the candidate's version and build
ID over RPC. Startup can require those imports, so candidate readiness is checked
after maintenance. A warning names the replaced PID and verified serving build.
HTTP health alone does not prove recovery. A refused stop or unverified restoration
records the failed phase and exact recovery commands in the update result.

Legacy post-core convergence retains service maintenance custody while its fresh
Doctor processes run, then restores the Gateway before publishing completion.
An ordinary healthy Gateway still follows the parent's activation policy;
`openclaw update --no-restart` does not grant state-repair access to a live writer.

Unavailable service inspection becomes a warning and grants no service-control
authority. Doctor still checks Gateway/state coordinators, agent-database leases,
and the temporary-file lock used by older Gateways such as 2026.6.33 before
repair. A live or unverifiable legacy lock owner blocks repair and names its PID
and lock path; stop that Gateway through its service owner, then run
`openclaw doctor --fix` from an independent shell. An unmatched service that can
still run also blocks maintenance; inspect it with `openclaw gateway status --deep`.
Once the native manager confirms it is offline, Doctor can repair its selected
state without changing or starting that service. A stopped or disabled systemd
unit need not remain loaded in the manager for state repair to proceed.

If migration or config repair cannot finish, Doctor leaves the stopped service
stopped and reports an incomplete repair with exit code 1. When state requires
manual recovery, the diagnosis names its path and the next action:

- **Unsupported canonical workspace version:** use an OpenClaw build that supports
  that version. Preserve the shared database unchanged.
- **Unreadable or conflicting exec policy:** stop the Gateway and node hosts,
  then reconcile the named legacy file or interrupted claim with a verified copy
  of the intended policy. Preserve the existing SQLite policy.

Doctor does not quarantine unsupported workspace state, discard future-version
rows, or infer execution policy. Repeating the same repair invocation cannot
resolve these conditions. After manual recovery, verify readiness before starting
the service through its owner.

## Examples

```bash
openclaw doctor
openclaw doctor --lint
openclaw doctor --json
openclaw doctor --lint --json
openclaw doctor --lint --severity-min warning
openclaw doctor --lint --all
openclaw doctor --lint --allow-exec
openclaw doctor --deep
openclaw doctor --fix
openclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive
openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token
openclaw doctor --post-upgrade
openclaw doctor --post-upgrade --json
openclaw doctor --state-sqlite compact
openclaw doctor --state-sqlite compact --json
openclaw doctor --session-sqlite inspect --session-sqlite-all-agents
openclaw doctor --session-sqlite dry-run --session-sqlite-agent main --json
openclaw doctor --session-sqlite import --session-sqlite-all-agents
openclaw doctor --session-sqlite validate --session-sqlite-all-agents --json
openclaw doctor --session-sqlite compact --session-sqlite-all-agents
openclaw doctor --session-sqlite recover --github-issue
openclaw doctor --session-sqlite restore --session-sqlite-all-agents
```

For channel-specific permissions, use the channel probes instead of `doctor`:

```bash
openclaw channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:<channel-id>
openclaw channels status --probe
```

`channels capabilities` reports the bot's effective permissions for a specific channel target. `channels status --probe` audits all configured channels and voice auto-join targets.

| `--allow-exec`                  | Allow doctor to execute configured `exec` SecretRefs while verifying secrets.                                                                                                                          |
| `--deep`                        | Scan system services for extra gateway installs; report recent Gateway supervisor restart handoffs.                                                                                                    |
| `--lint`                        | Run the [structured health checks](/cli/doctor/health-contract) in read-only mode and emit diagnostic findings.                                                                                        |
| `--post-upgrade`                | Run post-upgrade plugin compatibility probes; findings go to stdout; exit code 1 if any error-level finding is present.                                                                                |
| `--state-sqlite <mode>`         | Run explicit shared state SQLite maintenance. The only mode is `compact`.                                                                                                                              |
| `--session-sqlite <mode>`       | Run targeted session SQLite maintenance or legacy import: `inspect`, `dry-run`, `import`, `validate`, `compact`, `recover`, or `restore`.                                                              |
| `--session-sqlite-store <path>` | With `--session-sqlite`: select a SQLite database or legacy `sessions.json` source, subject to the mode's [selection rules](/cli/doctor/sqlite-maintenance#session-sqlite-migration).                  |
| `--session-sqlite-agent <id>`   | With `--session-sqlite`: select one configured agent.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `--session-sqlite-all-agents`   | With `--session-sqlite`: select configured and discovered agent stores.                                                                                                                                |
| `--github-issue`                | With `--session-sqlite recover`: prepare a sanitized openclaw/openclaw issue report; doctor creates it with `gh` after `--yes` or interactive confirmation.                                            |
| `--json`                        | Emit read-only JSON. Bare `--json` is advisory; combine with `--lint` for threshold-based exit codes. With another machine mode, emit that mode's existing JSON report.                                |
| `--severity-min <level>`        | With `--lint`: drop findings below `info`, `warning`, or `error`.                                                                                                                                      |
| `--all`                         | With `--lint`: run all registered checks, including opt-in checks excluded from the default set.                                                                                                       |
| `--skip <id>`                   | With `--lint`: skip a check id. Repeatable.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `--only <id>`                   | With `--lint`: run only the given check id(s). Repeatable.                                                                                                                                             |

`--severity-min`, `--all`, `--only`, and `--skip` are only accepted together with `--lint`. Bare `--json` uses the default read-only lint check selection but keeps Doctor's advisory exit behavior. Both read-only postures reject `--repair`, `--fix`, `--force`, `--yes`, and `--generate-gateway-token`. Explicit `--lint` also rejects `--session-sqlite` modes and their selectors, including `--github-issue`. Other machine modes can still use `--json` for their own output.
