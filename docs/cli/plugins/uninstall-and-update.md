This page covers the two commands that change an existing install:
`openclaw plugins uninstall` and `openclaw plugins update`.

## Uninstall

```bash
openclaw plugins uninstall <id>
openclaw plugins uninstall <id> --dry-run
openclaw plugins uninstall <id> --keep-files
openclaw plugins uninstall <id> --force
```

`uninstall` removes plugin settings from `plugins.entries`, the persisted plugin index, plugin allow/deny list entries, and any `plugins.load.paths` entry that exactly resolves to the recorded install path. It leaves only an exact `enabled: false` entry for each removed plugin id. This marker records the explicit uninstall choice so remaining model, provider, or channel selections do not automatically reinstall the package during startup repair. Reinstalling does not silently re-enable it; enabling the plugin again replaces the marker. For a package with multiple child entries, any child id resolves to the package owner; uninstall removes every sibling's policy and slot/channel references, the one package install record, and the managed directory once. Linked path installs also remove an exact entry for their recorded source path. Parent directories, child paths, prefix matches, and unrelated load paths are preserved. Unless `--keep-files` is set, uninstall also removes the tracked managed install directory, but only when it resolves inside OpenClaw's plugin extensions root. If the plugin currently owns the `memory` or `contextEngine` slot, that slot resets to its default (`memory-core` for memory, `legacy` for context engine).

Matching load-path references are removed before package files so symlink aliases cannot leave invalid config; if file removal fails, the plugin stays disabled and tracked so you can retry uninstall.

`uninstall` prints a preview of what will be removed. Multi-entry packages name the package owner and every affected child before prompting. Pass `--force` to skip the confirmation prompt (useful for scripts and non-interactive runs); without it, uninstall requires an interactive TTY. `--dry-run` prints the same preview and exits without prompting or changing anything.

If a tracked package has no discovered plugin entries, uninstall can remove its exact install record and same-owner policy, including owner-keyed channel config that no other discovered plugin claims. This recovery is allowed only when no other install record shares its package path and no discovered plugin matches its id or recorded paths. Unrelated policy remains unchanged. Registry refresh rebuilds discovery metadata; it does not remove these orphan install records.

Discovered packages with missing, ambiguous, or conflicting ownership still fail closed without changing package files, config, or the installed index. Run `openclaw plugins registry --refresh`, inspect `openclaw plugins doctor`, and use `openclaw doctor --fix` for repairable legacy index state. If ownership is still ambiguous, reinstall the package before retrying update or uninstall.

<Note>
`--keep-config` is supported as a deprecated alias for `--keep-files`.

## Update

```bash
openclaw plugins update <id-or-npm-spec>
openclaw plugins update --all
openclaw plugins update <id-or-npm-spec> --dry-run
openclaw plugins update @openclaw/voice-call
openclaw plugins update @acme/demo
openclaw plugins update openclaw-codex-app-server --acknowledge-install-policy-warning
```

Updates apply to tracked plugin installs in the managed plugin index and tracked hook-pack installs in shared SQLite state. They reuse the source that the user already chose when installing the plugin, so they do not require a second source acknowledgement.

`update --all` reports and skips orphaned path-source install records so remaining plugins can update. Remove an orphan record with `openclaw plugins uninstall <id>` when its files are no longer needed.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resolving plugin id vs npm spec">
    When you pass a plugin id, OpenClaw reuses the recorded install spec for that plugin. For a multi-entry package, a child id resolves to its package owner and updates every sibling together. If the new package version removes or renames children, OpenClaw removes the retired children's entries, allow/deny policy, exact child load paths, channel config, and memory/context slot selections while preserving retained/new children and unrelated plugins. Previously stored dist-tags such as `@beta` and exact pinned versions continue to be used on later `update <id>` runs.

    The narrow exception is a trusted official package completing a catalog-declared plugin id replacement. That update starts from the catalog package selector so the renamed manifest can replace the legacy id.

    Exact pinned npm and trusted official ClawHub installs stay pinned during targeted and bulk updates, including dry runs. If OpenClaw can resolve a newer release on the package's registry default line, it reports the pin and prints an explicit command to replace it. The ClawHub recovery command uses `plugins install clawhub:<package> --force` because `plugins update` accepts selector overrides only for npm records. Official plugins still follow the configured core-channel compatibility policy after the selector changes.

    Bulk `openclaw plugins update --all` also preserves ordinary exact pins and explicit tags. Floating trusted official records follow the current registry-channel policy. Doctor separately refreshes stale official runtime plugins bound to the current OpenClaw release cohort, keeping the recorded registry and recording an exact replacement version when the previous npm record was pinned.

    Older official-plugin syncs could record an exact version automatically. That record is indistinguishable from an intentional user pin, so OpenClaw reports newer releases without silently unpinning it. Use the printed package command when you want to change the recorded selector.

    For npm installs, you can also pass an explicit npm package spec with a dist-tag or exact version. OpenClaw resolves that package name back to the tracked plugin record, updates that installed plugin, and records the new npm spec for future id-based updates.

    Passing the npm package name without a version or tag also resolves back to the tracked plugin record. Use this when a plugin was pinned to an exact version and you want to move it back to the registry's default release line.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beta channel updates">
    Targeted `openclaw plugins update <id-or-npm-spec>` reuses the tracked plugin spec unless you pass a new spec. For floating trusted official records, it uses the canonical registry-channel resolver to choose the install target without rewriting the stored selector. Bulk `openclaw plugins update --all` uses the same resolver when it syncs trusted official plugin records to the official catalog target. On an installed beta core, eligible official npm and trusted official ClawHub plugins with default/latest intent target that exact core version when the effective plugin update channel is beta. This prevents a moving plugin `@beta` tag from selecting a different beta release. Targeted updates with an explicitly configured stable channel retain that selection. Explicit `beta`, `dev`, and `extended-stable` selections retain their existing precedence.

    `openclaw update` resolves plugin targets from the newly installed core, so a one-off beta `--tag` also aligns eligible official npm and trusted official ClawHub plugins even when the configured channel is stable. Other default-line npm and ClawHub plugin records on the beta channel try `@beta` first. OpenClaw falls back to the recorded default/latest spec only if the selected beta release is unavailable. Integrity, compatibility, trust, install-policy, and capability-consent failures do not trigger fallback. That fallback is reported as a warning and does not fail the core update. Exact versions and explicit non-`latest` tags stay pinned to that selector for targeted and bulk updates except while completing the trusted plugin id replacement above.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Existing plugin source choices">
    Updates retain the recorded npm or ClawHub source and selector. Older install records do not distinguish automatic ClawHub selection from an explicit `clawhub:` request, so OpenClaw does not silently switch those records to npm. To change an existing plugin deliberately, review and run `openclaw plugins install npm:<package> --force`. Automatic externalization of an image-owned bundled plugin uses npm first and its declared ClawHub source second.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version checks and integrity drift">
    Before a live npm update, OpenClaw checks the installed package version against the npm registry metadata. If the installed version and recorded artifact identity already match the resolved target, the update is skipped without downloading, reinstalling, or rewriting `openclaw.json`.

    When a stored integrity hash exists and the fetched artifact hash changes, OpenClaw treats that as npm artifact drift. The interactive `openclaw plugins update` command prints the expected and actual hashes and asks for confirmation before proceeding. Non-interactive update helpers fail closed unless the caller supplies an explicit continuation policy.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="--acknowledge-install-policy-warning on update">
    `plugins update` uses the same warning acknowledgement as install, with `type: '<plugin>' to update anyway` in an interactive terminal. The policy is re-evaluated, and `block` or a policy failure remains terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ClawHub Security Audit on update">
    Community ClawHub-backed plugin updates run the same exact-release trust check as installs before downloading the replacement package. Review outcomes are printed informationally and continue; blocked releases remain non-installable. Official ClawHub packages and bundled OpenClaw plugin sources bypass this release-trust check.
