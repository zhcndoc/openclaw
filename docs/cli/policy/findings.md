A finding can include both `target` (the observed workspace thing that does
not conform) and `requirement` (the authored rule that made it a finding).
Both are `oc://` address strings, but the field names describe policy
role rather than address format.

## Repair

`doctor --lint` and `policy check` are read-only.

`doctor --fix` only edits policy-managed workspace settings when
`workspaceRepairs` is explicitly enabled; otherwise checks report what they
would repair and leave settings unchanged.

Repair can disable channels denied by `channels.denyRules` and
apply the automatic narrowing repairs listed below. Enable `workspaceRepairs`
only after the policy file has been reviewed, because a valid rule can change
workspace config:

- set `tools.elevated.enabled=false` when a global policy forbids elevated tools
- add missing required-deny tool ids to `tools.deny` or
  `agents.entries.*.tools.deny` when policy requires those tools to be denied
- set insecure `gateway.controlUi.*` toggles to `false`
- set `gateway.mode=local` when policy denies remote gateway mode
- set reported `gateway.http.endpoints.*.enabled` paths to `false` when policy
  denies Gateway HTTP API endpoints
- set reported channel ingress `groupPolicy` paths to `allowlist` when policy
  denies open group ingress
- set reported channel ingress `requireMention` paths to `true` when policy
  requires group mentions
- set `diagnostics.otel.captureContent=false`, or
  `diagnostics.otel.captureContent.enabled=false` for object-form telemetry
  capture settings, when policy denies telemetry content capture

Scoped elevated-tools repairs are detect-only. Scoped data-handling repairs are
also skipped when the finding reports shared telemetry config, because changing
the shared setting would affect more than the scoped policy target.

`dataHandling.sensitiveLogging.requireRedaction` has no check and no repair.
Sensitive log redaction is unconditional in OpenClaw, so nothing can report it
as disabled. The key stays a supported policy rule: `openclaw policy` validates
its shape, `openclaw policy compare` still requires a candidate policy to be at
least as strict as the baseline for it, and `openclaw policy check` records the
runtime invariant `oc://openclaw.invariant/logging/redaction` in the
`dataHandling` evidence and attestation as proof the requirement is satisfied.

Scoped required-deny repairs are skipped when the finding reports inherited
root `tools.deny`, because adding the required tool to root config would affect
more than the scoped policy target. Agent-local required-deny repairs can update
the reported `agents.entries.*.tools.deny` path.

Scoped channel ingress repairs are skipped when the finding reports inherited
`channels.defaults.*`, because changing the shared channel default would affect
more than the scoped policy target. Gateway HTTP URL-fetch allowlist findings
remain manual because automatic repair cannot choose the correct endpoint URL
allowlist values.

Gateway bind and node-command findings stay review-required. When
`policy/gateway-non-loopback-bind` or `policy/gateway-node-command-denied`
can be mapped to a config path, `doctor --fix` reports the proposed
`gateway.bind` or `gateway.nodes.commands.deny` change as skipped preview
guidance. It does not apply the change, and the finding does not count as
repaired until an operator reviews and updates config or policy.

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "policy": {
        "config": {
          "workspaceRepairs": true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```
