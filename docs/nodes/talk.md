summary: "Talk mode: continuous speech conversations across local STT/TTS and realtime voice"
read_when:
  - Implementing Talk mode on macOS/iOS/Android
  - Using standalone voice on Apple Watch
  - Changing voice/TTS/interrupt behavior
title: "Talk mode"
---

Talk mode covers these runtime shapes:

- **Native macOS/iOS/Android Talk**: native speech recognition, Gateway chat, and `talk.speak` TTS. Apple Speech recognition on macOS/iOS may use network services; Android behavior depends on the installed speech service. Nodes advertise the `talk` capability and declare which `talk.*` commands they support.
- **iOS Talk (realtime)**: client-owned WebRTC for OpenAI realtime configs that select `webrtc` transport or omit transport, including framed and frameless transcript/audio events. Explicit `gateway-relay`, `provider-websocket`, and non-OpenAI realtime configs stay on the Gateway-owned relay; non-realtime configs use the native speech loop.
- **Apple Watch standalone Talk**: native WebRTC/Opus over UDP with Gateway-owned call control (`gateway-control-v1`). The Watch uses the Gateway's configured realtime provider and keeps tools and transcript ownership on the Gateway; unsupported configurations fail visibly without a relay fallback.
- **Browser Talk**: `talk.client.create` for client-owned `webrtc`/`provider-websocket` sessions, or `talk.session.create` for Gateway-owned `gateway-relay` sessions. `managed-room` is reserved for Gateway handoff and walkie-talkie rooms.
- **Android Talk (realtime)**: Android uses Gateway-owned relay realtime when `talk.catalog` reports the realtime group ready and the configured model passes the Android client gate; it never opens a client-owned WebRTC session. The Gateway now supports `gpt-live-*` relay sessions, but Android intentionally keeps those models on native speech recognition, Gateway chat, and `talk.speak` until the relay path is proven live from an Android device.
- **Transcription-only clients**: `talk.session.create({ mode: "transcription", transport: "gateway-relay", brain: "none" })`, then `talk.session.appendAudio` and `talk.session.close` for captions/dictation without an assistant voice response. One-shot uploaded voice notes still use the [media understanding](/nodes/media-understanding) audio path.

Native Talk is a continuous loop: listen for speech, send the transcript to the model through the active session, wait for the response, then speak it via the configured Talk provider (`talk.speak`).

For replies dominated by fenced code, `talk.speak` uses a short spoken message directing the listener to the screen. Inline code and ordinary prose remain part of the spoken reply.

Apple Watch also retains **Talk to Claw**, the separate [one-turn companion flow](/platforms/ios#talk-to-claw-with-the-iphone): native dictation, text relayed through the iPhone, and system-voice readback. **Talk on Watch** is the realtime path included in normal Watch setup; see [standalone voice setup](/platforms/ios#standalone-voice).

## Talk documentation pages

Talk mode is documented on this page and four child pages, one per reader job.

## Where each section moved

Every section heading from the previous single-page version keeps its anchor
here, so an existing link such as `/nodes/talk#session-ownership` still
resolves. Each entry points at the page that now holds the content.

## Voice directives in replies

The assistant can prefix a reply with a single JSON line to control voice:

```json
{ "voice": "<voice-id>", "once": true }
```

Rules:

- First non-empty line only; the JSON line is stripped before TTS playback.
- Unknown keys are ignored.
- `once: true` applies to the current reply only; without it, the voice becomes the new Talk mode default.

Supported keys: `voice` / `voice_id` / `voiceId`, `model` / `model_id` / `modelId`, `speed`, `rate` (WPM), `stability`, `similarity`, `style`, `speakerBoost`, `seed`, `normalize`, `lang`, `output_format`, `latency_tier`, `once`.

OpenAI browser WebRTC and Gateway-relay Talk support native GPT-Live. The
released route remains available in **Settings → Talk**. Account-issued,
unlisted routes can be set in `talk.realtime.model`, but are not published
through catalogs or diagnostics. Browser Talk uses client WebRTC with
Gateway-owned control. Gateway relay uses Gateway-owned WebRTC for the released
route with either OAuth or Platform fallback. Unlisted routes and other backend
consumers use the direct Platform-only transport.

For browser and Gateway-relay Talk, the released route prefers an OpenClaw
ChatGPT OAuth profile and falls back to Platform API-key authentication.
Unlisted routes never use OAuth and require a Platform key. GPT-Live browser
Talk also requires the bundled `openai` plugin registered in full mode; a
restrictive `plugins.allow` list fails session creation with "OpenAI GPT-Live
browser session broker is unavailable".
Runtime bounds: 8 concurrent sessions per Gateway and a 30-minute session TTL.
Browser sessions also use 60-second single-use offer tokens.

The released route uses `arbor`, `breeze`, `cove`, `ember`, `juniper`, `maple`,
`sol`, `spruce`, and `vale`, with `cove` as the default. Unlisted routes use
their account-issued voice contract; the current Platform profile accepts
`marin` and `cedar`, with `marin` as the default. A rejected session does not
identify the cause by itself; check the selected account, model, and voice.

| Apple Watch standalone Talk | Gateway-controlled WebRTC implemented; physical Watch verification pending  |
| Android realtime Talk       | Pending an Android device live-proof flip; Android stays on native Talk     |

These rows describe implemented transport paths, not account entitlement or a
successful live call on every device. iOS implements frameless transcripts and
the Gateway offer exchange; Android retains an explicit GPT-Live model gate.
For model capability limits, see [Discord voice policies](/channels/discord/voice-channels#voice-channels)
and [Voice Call tools](/plugins/voice-call#realtime-voice-conversations).

The Gateway-owned WebRTC route keeps OAuth and Platform credentials away from
relay clients. Backend WebSocket paths keep the Platform key on the Gateway;
OpenClaw converts telephony G.711 u-law audio to and from GPT-Live's 24 kHz PCM
contract.

For GA `gpt-realtime-2.1`, `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini`, and `gpt-realtime-2`
browser sessions, Platform credentials remain preferred in this order: the
configured realtime API key, an `openai` API-key profile, then
`OPENAI_API_KEY`. With none configured, browser Talk falls back to an OpenClaw
ChatGPT OAuth profile and exchanges SDP through the Gateway's single-use offer
broker, so the OAuth token never reaches the browser. A configured Platform
credential that cannot be resolved fails closed instead of silently falling
through to OAuth.

iOS client-owned WebRTC, GA Gateway relay, and Android realtime remain
Platform-key-only. GA browser Talk keeps the existing client-owned data channel
and `talk.client.toolCall` loop; only the credential owner and SDP exchange path
change under OAuth. The released GPT-Live route remains OAuth-first with
Platform fallback for browser and Gateway-owned WebRTC; direct backend sockets
and unlisted GPT-Live routes remain Platform-key-only.

Overrides `realtime.providers.<id>.model` when both are set — the same precedence `talk.client.create` applies at session time.                                                                                                          |
| `realtime.transport`                     | -                                           | `webrtc`: OpenAI WebRTC on iOS, in the browser, and on Watch with Gateway control. `provider-websocket`: browser-owned, stays on Gateway relay on iOS. `gateway-relay`: keeps provider audio on the Gateway; Android uses realtime only with this transport.   |
| `realtime.brain`                         | -                                           | `agent-consult` routes realtime tool calls through Gateway policy; `direct-tools` is legacy direct-tool compatibility; `none` is for transcription/external orchestration.                                                                                     |
| `realtime.consultRouting`                | -                                           | `provider-direct` preserves the provider's direct reply when it skips `openclaw_agent_consult`; `force-agent-consult` routes finalized user transcripts through OpenClaw instead.                                                                              |
| `realtime.instructions`                  | -                                           | Appends provider-facing system instructions to OpenClaw's built-in realtime prompt.                                                                                                                                                                            |

`talk.catalog` exposes canonical provider ids and registry aliases, each provider's valid modes/transports/brain strategies/realtime audio formats/capability flags, and the runtime-selected readiness result. First-party Talk clients should read that catalog instead of maintaining provider aliases locally; treat an older Gateway that omits group readiness as unverified rather than definitively unconfigured. Streaming transcription providers are discovered through `talk.catalog.transcription`; the current Gateway relay uses the Voice Call streaming provider config until a dedicated Talk transcription config surface ships.

## Notes

- Native speech recognition requires the platform's speech and microphone access. Standalone Watch realtime requires microphone access, not local speech recognition.
- Native Talk uses the active Gateway session and only falls back to history polling when response events are unavailable.
- The gateway resolves Talk playback through `talk.speak` using the active Talk provider. Android falls back to local system TTS only when that RPC is unavailable.
- macOS local MLX playback uses the bundled `openclaw-mlx-tts` helper when present, or an executable on `PATH`. Set `OPENCLAW_MLX_TTS_BIN` to point at a custom helper binary during development. The helper streams PCM, keeps one selected model resident, and supports Fish S2 Pro reference audio through `providers.mlx.referenceAudioPath` plus `referenceText`.
- Voice directive value ranges (ElevenLabs): `stability`, `similarity`, and `style` accept `0..1`; `speed` accepts `0.5..2`; `latency_tier` accepts `0..4`.
