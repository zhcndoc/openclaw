Use this page when a node is visible in status but node tools fail.

## Node goes offline after SSH logout (Linux)

On Linux, `openclaw node install` creates a **user-level** systemd service. The
`systemd --user` instance is torn down when your last login session ends, so the
node service stops the moment you log out — even though it looked healthy
(`enabled` + `running`) while you were connected.

Check lingering:

```bash
loginctl show-user "$USER" -p Linger
```

If it reads `Linger=no`, enable it (may require sudo):

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

Then restart the node service and verify it survives logout:

```bash
openclaw node restart
# log out, then from another machine:
openclaw nodes status
```

`openclaw node install` prints a warning with this recovery command when it
detects lingering is disabled. Don't mix a user-level service with a
system-level one for the same node. The duplicate-scope guard that prevents
two managers from running the same unit name is enforced for gateway units
(two supervisors on the same port SIGTERM each other in a restart loop); for
node services the installer does not raise this guard, so a leftover unit in
the other scope can leave the node in an ambiguous state. Fully remove one
before switching.

## Command ladder

```bash
openclaw status
openclaw gateway status
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw doctor
openclaw channels status --probe
```

Then run node-specific checks:

```bash
openclaw nodes pending
openclaw nodes status
openclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw approvals get --node <idOrNameOrIp>
```

Healthy signals:

- Node is connected and paired for role `node`.
- `nodes describe` includes the capability you're calling.
- Exec approvals show the expected mode/allowlist.

If startup preparation disables container session hosting that you enabled, check the node host's
local stderr for `node host worker hosting disabled: ...` and follow the reported
engine or context recovery guidance. The macOS app forwards worker stderr to its
logger under subsystem `ai.openclaw`, category `node-host-worker`; see
[macOS logging](/platforms/mac/logging) for capture options. After fixing the cause,
restart the node host. Explicitly disabled hosting produces no such diagnostic.

## Foreground requirements

`camera.*` and `screen.*` are foreground-only on iOS/Android nodes.

Quick check and fix:

```bash
openclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw logs --follow
```

If you see `NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE`, bring the node app to the foreground and retry.

| `system.run`                 | n/a (node host path)                    | n/a (node host path)                         | Exec approvals required          | `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED`                           |

## Pairing versus approvals

Four separate approval and policy gates control whether a node command succeeds:

1. **Device pairing**: can this node connect to the gateway?
2. **Node command surface approval**: has the declared command been approved through `openclaw nodes pending` and `openclaw nodes approve <nodeRequestId>`?
3. **Gateway node command policy**: is the RPC command ID allowed by `gateway.nodes.commands.allow` / `gateway.nodes.commands.deny` and platform defaults?
4. **Exec approvals**: can this node run a specific shell command locally?

Device pairing admits the identity; surface approval limits the commands on its
paired-device record. The two request IDs are distinct. An initial unapproved
surface exposes no effective commands. A pending expansion retains only commands
that were already approved, remain declared, and pass Gateway policy. For
`system.run`, shell allowlist and ask policy live in the node's exec approvals
(`openclaw approvals get --node ...`), not the pairing record. Platform permissions
and foreground requirements still apply.

Quick checks:

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw nodes pending
openclaw nodes status
openclaw approvals get --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw approvals allowlist add --node <idOrNameOrIp> "/usr/bin/uname"
```

- Pairing missing: approve the current device request with `openclaw devices approve <deviceRequestId>`, then restart or rerun a node paused on `PAIRING_REQUIRED`. The reconnect creates the separate surface request.
- Node paired and connected with an initial empty command list: inspect `openclaw nodes pending` and approve its distinct `<nodeRequestId>` with `openclaw nodes approve <nodeRequestId>`.
- `nodes describe` missing a command: check the gateway node command policy and whether the node actually declared that command on connect.
- Surface approved but `system.run` fails: check Gateway policy, then exec approvals/allowlist on that node.

SSH-verified and bootstrap enrollment can approve the first surface automatically.
Trusted-network device approval does not. Later command, capability, or permission
expansion still needs surface approval.

For approval-backed `host=node` runs, the gateway also binds execution to the prepared canonical `systemRunPlan`. If a later caller mutates the command, cwd, or session metadata before the approved run is forwarded, the gateway rejects the run as an approval mismatch instead of trusting the edited payload.

## Common node error codes

| `LOCATION_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE`      | App is backgrounded but only While Using permission exists.                                                                                                                             |
| `COMPUTER_DISABLED`                    | Enable **Allow Computer Control** in the macOS app, then approve the pairing update.                                                                                                    |

| `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: approval required` | Exec request needs explicit approval.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss`    | Command blocked by allowlist mode. On Windows node hosts, shell-wrapper forms like `cmd.exe /c ...` are treated as allowlist misses in allowlist mode unless approved via the ask flow. |

## Fast recovery loop

```bash
openclaw nodes status
openclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw approvals get --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw logs --follow
```

If still stuck:

- Re-approve device pairing.
- Restart or rerun a node paused for manual pairing, then approve its pending surface request with `openclaw nodes pending` / `openclaw nodes approve <nodeRequestId>`.
- Re-open the node app (foreground).
- Re-grant OS permissions.
- Recreate/adjust the exec approval policy.

For computer control, also verify that the node-local Computer Control toggle is enabled, its pairing update is approved, a vision-capable agent exposes the `computer` tool, and `screen.snapshot` succeeds with Screen Recording permission. A `gateway.nodes.commands.deny` entry always overrides a platform default or `gateway.nodes.commands.allow`.
