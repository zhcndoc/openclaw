OpenClaw can auto-configure Tailscale **Serve** (tailnet) or **Funnel** (public) for the Gateway dashboard and WebSocket port. This keeps the gateway bound to loopback while Tailscale provides HTTPS, routing, and (for Serve) identity headers.

## Modes

`gateway.tailscale.mode`:

| Mode            | Behavior                                                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serve`         | Tailnet-only Serve via `tailscale serve`. The gateway stays on `127.0.0.1`. |
| `funnel`        | Public HTTPS via `tailscale funnel`. Requires a shared password.            |
| `off` (default) | No Tailscale automation.                                                    |

Status and audit output use **Tailscale exposure** for this OpenClaw Serve/Funnel mode. `off` means OpenClaw is not managing Serve or Funnel; it does not mean the local Tailscale daemon is stopped or logged out.

## Config examples

### Tailnet-only (Serve)

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "loopback",
    tailscale: { mode: "serve" },
  },
}
```

Open: `https://<magicdns>/` (or your configured `gateway.controlUi.basePath`)

### Tailnet-only (bind to Tailnet IP)

Use this to have the gateway listen directly on the Tailnet IP, with no Serve/Funnel:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "tailnet",
    auth: { mode: "token", token: "your-token" },
  },
}
```

Connect a native or CLI client from another Tailnet device:

- WebSocket: `ws://<tailscale-ip>:18789`

Do not use the direct plain-HTTP address for the browser Control UI. Remote plain HTTP cannot create browser device identity, and token/password auth does not replace it. Use Tailscale Serve for the Control UI.

<Note>
When a bindable Tailnet IPv4 is present, the Gateway also requires `http://127.0.0.1:18789` for authenticated same-host clients. If no Tailnet address is available at startup, it falls back to loopback only; restart after Tailscale becomes available to add direct Tailnet access. Neither path adds LAN or public exposure.
</Note>

### Public internet (Funnel + shared password)

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "loopback",
    tailscale: { mode: "funnel" },
    auth: { mode: "password", password: "replace-me" },
  },
}
```

Prefer `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` over committing a password to disk.

## CLI examples

```bash
openclaw gateway --tailscale serve
openclaw gateway --tailscale funnel --auth password
```

## Auth

`gateway.auth.mode` controls the handshake:

| Mode                                                   | Use case                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`                                                 | Private ingress only                                                                |
| `token` (default when `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is set) | Shared token                                                                        |
| `password`                                             | Shared secret via `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` or config                             |
| `trusted-proxy`                                        | Identity-aware reverse proxy; see [Trusted Proxy Auth](/gateway/trusted-proxy-auth) |

### Tailscale identity headers (Serve only)

When `tailscale.mode: "serve"` and `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` is `true`, Control UI/WebSocket auth can use Tailscale identity headers (`tailscale-user-login`) instead of a token/password. OpenClaw verifies the header by resolving the request's `x-forwarded-for` address via the local Tailscale daemon (`tailscale whois`) and matching it to the header login before accepting it. A request only qualifies when it reaches OpenClaw's dedicated managed-Tailscale listener with Tailscale's `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-proto`, and `x-forwarded-host` headers; sending those headers to the ordinary Gateway listener is rejected.

This tokenless flow assumes the gateway host is trusted. If untrusted local code may run on the same host, set `gateway.auth.allowTailscale: false` and require token/password auth instead.

Scope of the bypass:

- Applies to the Control UI WebSocket auth surface and read-only `GET`/`HEAD` requests for Control UI profile avatars. Other HTTP API endpoints (`/v1/*`, `/tools/invoke`, `/api/channels/*`, etc.) never use Tailscale identity-header auth; they always follow the gateway's normal HTTP auth mode.
- For Control UI operator sessions that already carry browser device identity, a verified Tailscale identity skips the bootstrap-token/QR pairing round trip.
- It does not bypass device identity itself: device-less clients are still rejected, and node-role connections still go through normal pairing and auth checks.

## Notes

- Tailscale Serve/Funnel requires the `tailscale` CLI installed and logged in.
- `tailscale.mode: "funnel"` refuses to start unless auth mode is `password`, to avoid public exposure.
- OpenClaw holds Serve/Funnel as a foreground Tailscale claim. Gateway startup succeeds only after the claim is active, and stopping or losing the Gateway releases it automatically.
- Named Tailscale Services are not supported by managed ingress because Tailscale requires them to run as persistent background routes. Existing `gateway.tailscale.serviceName` installs must run `openclaw doctor --fix`; Doctor disables managed ingress and removes the key. Inspect the retained Service route, clear it with `tailscale serve clear <service-name>`, then enable device Serve with `gateway.tailscale.mode: "serve"` if desired.
- Older releases could advertise an externally configured default HTTPS Serve route that targeted a `gateway.bind: "lan"` listener. That route no longer has trusted ingress provenance. Run `openclaw doctor` to preview an atomic migration to `gateway.bind: "loopback"` plus `gateway.tailscale.mode: "serve"`; apply it with `openclaw doctor --fix`, then restart the Gateway so it can claim the route through managed ingress. Doctor does not reset Tailscale state or guess how to rewrite custom Serve ports and Tailscale Services; migrate those manually.
- `gateway.tailscale.preserveFunnel: true` is a deprecated migration guard. It detects an externally configured `tailscale funnel` route before reapplying Serve. If that route still targets the ordinary Gateway listener, OpenClaw leaves it unchanged and warns because requests lack managed-ingress provenance. Plugin-authenticated webhook routes such as Google Chat and SMS keep using their own signature/auth checks and ignore forwarded client claims; Gateway-authenticated HTTP and WebSocket routes reject that ingress. First configure a durable `gateway.auth.password` (prefer a SecretRef) or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`, then set `gateway.auth.mode` to `password`. After password auth is ready, run `openclaw config set gateway.tailscale.mode funnel`, then `openclaw config unset gateway.tailscale.preserveFunnel`; managed Funnel targets the dedicated ingress.
- `gateway.bind: "tailnet"` uses a direct Tailnet bind (no HTTPS, no Serve/Funnel) plus required local `127.0.0.1` when a Tailnet IPv4 is available; otherwise it falls back to loopback only.
- `gateway.bind: "auto"` prefers loopback; use `tailnet` to limit network exposure to the Tailnet while retaining same-host loopback access.
- Serve/Funnel only expose the **Gateway control UI + WS**. Nodes connect over the same Gateway WS endpoint, so Serve works for node access too.

### Tailscale prerequisites and limits

- Serve requires HTTPS enabled for your tailnet; the CLI prompts if it is missing.
- Serve injects Tailscale identity headers; Funnel does not.
- OpenClaw-managed Serve/Funnel proxy to a dedicated `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral-port>` listener while ordinary local clients keep the configured Gateway port. Startup fails closed rather than sharing listener provenance, and the foreground claim releases the route when its Gateway owner disappears.
- Funnel requires Tailscale v1.38.3+, MagicDNS, HTTPS enabled, and a funnel node attribute.
- Funnel only supports ports `443`, `8443`, and `10000` over TLS.
- Funnel on macOS requires the open-source Tailscale app variant.

## Browser control (remote Gateway + local browser)

To run the Gateway on one machine but drive a browser on another, run a **node host** on the browser machine and keep both on the same tailnet. The Gateway proxies browser actions to the node; no separate control server or Serve URL is needed.

Avoid Funnel for browser control; treat node pairing like operator access.
