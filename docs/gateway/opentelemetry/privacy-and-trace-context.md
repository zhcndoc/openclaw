## Continue an upstream WebSocket trace

An authenticated Gateway WebSocket client can attach a W3C `traceparent` to
each request frame:

```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "eval-item-42",
  "method": "agent",
  "params": {},
  "traceparent": "00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01"
}
```

The Gateway creates a child request context that preserves the upstream trace
ID and sampling flags. Agent, harness, model-call, provider, tool-execution, and
exec spans created inside the request remain on that trace, including spans
recorded after their parent run has already finished. This allows a local
experiment runner to create one Langfuse/OpenTelemetry trace per dataset item and
correlate the corresponding OpenClaw execution.

Trace context is request-scoped, not connection-scoped. On a long-lived
WebSocket, generate or inject the appropriate `traceparent` independently for
every RPC. Concurrent requests remain isolated even when their work
interleaves.

The field is accepted only after the existing Gateway authentication handshake
and does not affect authentication or method authorization. A `traceparent` on
the initial `connect` frame is ignored. Missing or syntactically malformed
values within the 128-character field limit silently fall back to a fresh
request trace; longer values make the request frame invalid. `tracestate` and
`baggage` are not accepted by the Gateway WebSocket protocol.

## Privacy and content capture

Raw model/tool content is **not** exported by default. Spans carry bounded
identifiers (channel, provider, model, error category, hash-only request ids,
tool source, tool owner, skill name/source) and never include prompt text,
response text, tool inputs, tool outputs, skill file paths, or session keys.
Values that look like scoped agent session keys (for example starting with
`agent:`) are replaced with `unknown` on low-cardinality attributes. OTLP log
records keep severity, logger, code location, trusted trace context, and
sanitized attributes by default; the raw log message body is exported only
when `diagnostics.otel.captureContent` is `true`. Talk metrics export only
bounded event metadata (mode, transport, provider, event type) - no
transcripts, audio payloads, session ids, turn ids, call ids, room ids, or
handoff tokens.

When `diagnostics-otel` tracing is active, outbound model requests may include
a W3C `traceparent` header from the actual exporter-owned model-call span.
Diagnostic trace IDs and span IDs only correlate events to that span; they are
not used as outbound OTel identities. If the exporter cannot resolve a real
span context, OpenClaw omits the header instead of naming an unexported parent.
Existing caller-supplied `traceparent` headers are removed or replaced, so
plugins or custom provider options cannot spoof cross-service trace ancestry.

Set `diagnostics.otel.captureContent` to `true` only when your collector and
retention policy are approved for prompt, response, tool, and tool-definition
text. This enables bounded, redacted input messages, output messages, tool
inputs, tool outputs, tool definitions, and OTLP log bodies. System prompts
remain excluded. Provider-internal `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` payloads
are also excluded: compatibility attributes retain only a redacted structural
marker, while GenAI message attributes omit those parts.

`toolInputs`/`toolOutputs` content is captured for the built-in agent
runtime's tool executions (`openclaw.content.tool_input` and
`gen_ai.tool.call.arguments` on completed/error spans;
`openclaw.content.tool_output` and `gen_ai.tool.call.result` on completed
spans). The `openclaw.content.*` names remain the stable OpenClaw attribute
names; the `gen_ai.tool.call.*` copies mirror them for semconv-native viewers.
External harness tool calls (Codex, Claude CLI) emit
`tool.execution.*` spans without content payloads. Captured content travels on a
trusted, listener-only channel and is never placed on the public diagnostic event
bus.
