Methods an operator client calls on behalf of a person: helper reads, exec approval resolution, and delivery behavior for agent runs.

## Operator helper methods

- `commands.list` (`operator.read`) fetches the runtime command inventory for
  an agent.
  - `agentId` is optional; omit it to read the default agent workspace.
  - `scope` controls which surface the primary `name` targets: `text` returns
    the primary text command token without the leading `/`; `native` and the
    default `both` path return provider-aware native names when available.
  - `textAliases` carries exact slash aliases such as `/model` and `/m`.
  - `nativeName` carries the provider-aware native command name when one
    exists.
  - `provider` is optional and only affects native naming plus native plugin
    command availability.
  - `includeArgs=false` omits serialized argument metadata from the response.
- `tools.catalog` (`operator.read`) fetches the runtime tool catalog for an
  agent. The response includes grouped tools and provenance metadata:
  - `source`: `core` or `plugin`
  - `pluginId`: plugin owner when `source="plugin"`
  - `optional`: whether a plugin tool is optional
- `tools.effective` (`operator.read`) fetches the runtime-effective tool
  inventory for a session.
  - `sessionKey` is required.
  - The gateway derives trusted runtime context from the session server-side
    instead of accepting caller-supplied auth or delivery context.
  - The response is a session-scoped server-derived projection of the active
    inventory, including core, plugin, channel, and already-discovered MCP
    server tools.
  - `tools.effective` is read-only for MCP: it may project a warm session MCP
    catalog through the final tool policy, but does not create MCP runtimes,
    connect transports, or issue `tools/list`. If no matching warm catalog
    exists, the response may include a notice such as `mcp-not-yet-connected`,
    `mcp-not-yet-listed`, or `mcp-stale-catalog`.
  - Effective tool entries use `source="core"`, `source="plugin"`,
    `source="channel"`, or `source="mcp"`.
- `tools.invoke` (`operator.write`) invokes one available tool through the
  same gateway policy path as `/tools/invoke`.
  - `name` is required. `args`, `sessionKey`, `agentId`, `confirm`, and
    `idempotencyKey` are optional.
  - If both `sessionKey` and `agentId` are present, the resolved session agent
    must match `agentId`.
  - Owner-only core wrappers such as `cron`, `gateway`, and `nodes` require
    owner/admin identity (`operator.admin`) even though `tools.invoke` itself
    is `operator.write`.
  - The response is an SDK-facing envelope with `ok`, `toolName`, optional
    `output`, and typed `error` fields. Approval or policy refusals return
    `ok:false` in the payload rather than bypassing the gateway tool policy
    pipeline.
- `skills.status` (`operator.read`) fetches the visible skill inventory for an
  agent.
  - `agentId` is optional; omit it to read the default agent workspace.
  - The response includes eligibility, missing requirements, config checks,
    and sanitized install options without exposing raw secret values.
- `skills.search` and `skills.detail` (`operator.read`) return ClawHub
  discovery metadata.
- `skills.upload.begin`, `skills.upload.chunk`, and `skills.upload.commit`
  (`operator.admin`) stage a private skill archive before installing it. This
  is a separate admin upload path for trusted clients, not the normal ClawHub
  skill install flow, and is disabled by default unless
  `skills.install.allowUploadedArchives` is enabled.
  - `skills.upload.begin({ kind: "skill-archive", slug, sizeBytes, sha256?, force?, idempotencyKey? })`
    creates an upload bound to that slug and force value.
  - `skills.upload.chunk({ uploadId, offset, dataBase64 })` appends bytes at
    the exact decoded offset.
  - `skills.upload.commit({ uploadId, sha256? })` verifies the final size and
    SHA-256. Commit only finalizes the upload; it does not install the skill.
  - Uploaded skill archives are zip archives containing a `SKILL.md` root. The
    archive's internal directory name never selects the install target.
- `skills.install` (`operator.admin`) has three modes:
  - ClawHub mode: `{ source: "clawhub", slug, version?, force? }` installs a
    skill folder into the default agent workspace `skills/` directory.
  - Upload mode: `{ source: "upload", uploadId, slug, force?, sha256?, timeoutMs? }`
    installs a committed upload into the default agent workspace
    `skills/<slug>` directory. The slug and force value must match the
    original `skills.upload.begin` request. Rejected unless
    `skills.install.allowUploadedArchives` is enabled; the setting does not
    affect ClawHub installs.
  - Gateway installer mode: `{ name, installId, timeoutMs? }` runs a declared
    `metadata.openclaw.install` action on the gateway host. Older clients may
    still send `dangerouslyForceUnsafeInstall`; this field is deprecated,
    accepted only for protocol compatibility, and ignored. Use
    `security.installPolicy` for operator-owned install decisions.
- `skills.update` (`operator.admin`) has two modes:
  - ClawHub mode updates one tracked slug or all tracked ClawHub installs in
    the default agent workspace. Updates that would replace a skill directory
    whose installed files no longer match the recorded install digests are
    refused; the per-skill failure in `details.results` carries
    `code: "force_required"`. Retry with the optional `force: true` parameter
    to replace such a skill anyway.
  - Config mode patches `skills.entries.<skillKey>` values such as `enabled`,
    `apiKey`, and `env`.

### `models.list` views

`models.list` accepts an optional `view` parameter
(`src/agents/model-catalog-visibility.ts`):

- Omitted or `"default"`: if `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow` is configured, the
  response is the allowed catalog, including dynamically discovered models
  for `provider/*` entries. Otherwise the response is the full gateway
  catalog.
- `"configured"`: picker-sized behavior. If `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow` is
  configured, it still wins, including published rows matched by
  `provider/*` entries. Without an allowlist, the response uses explicit
  `models.providers.<provider>.models` entries, falling back to the full
  catalog only when no configured model rows exist.
- `"provider-config"`: source-authored `models.providers.*.models` inventory,
  independent of picker allowlists. Rows include public model capabilities and
  route-aware availability, but omit provider endpoints, auth material, and
  runtime request configuration.
- `"all"`: full gateway catalog, bypassing `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow`. Use for
  diagnostics/discovery UIs, not normal model pickers.

Ordinary requests read the published catalog without starting provider discovery.
Views select rows; they do not decide whether discovery runs. If the owner is not
published yet, the request reports that the model catalog is not ready. A result
whose owner becomes stale during projection is rejected for retry.

- `preparedOnly: true` remains supported for automatic clients. Ordinary reads
  are passive with or without this flag.
- `refresh: true` requests provider acquisition before reading the new published
  generation. Concurrent refreshes share the owner build. A failed acquisition
  retains compatible rows and reports its `providerOutcomes`; successful empty
  acquisition remains empty.
- `provider: "<id>"` filters the published result through the captured provider
  aliases. Unknown provider IDs are rejected.
- `includeDetails: true` includes available input modalities, effective
  `contextTokens`, and a `local` endpoint classification. It does not expose
  endpoint URLs, headers, credentials, costs or runtime request parameters.

For a conversation picker, pass `sessionKey` to read the session's canonical
agent and saved account selection. A conflicting `agentId` is rejected. The
viewer's current account default does not replace a saved session's selection.
For a new draft, `authProfileId` previews a retained account owned by the
identified caller with `operator.read` access. It does not save an account
default. `sessionKey` and `authProfileId` are mutually exclusive.

Session and identified-account results include `accountSelection` display facts
with the models. Collaborators do not receive another person's private account
locator. The `provider-config` view remains shared authored inventory and omits
account selection. `refreshFailed: true` reports a failed acquisition while
compatible rows remain usable; recovery clears it. A successful empty catalog
remains empty.

The Gateway advertises `session-scoped-model-catalog` for this contract.
`chat.metadata` remains available to legacy clients; the Control UI reads models
directly and keeps commands in its metadata cache. Opening a conversation picker
performs a passive read, without a model-cache timer or implicit provider refresh.
The Models settings page uses `preparedOnly: true` for its initial load, then
requests `refresh: true` the first time a primary, utility, or fallback model
picker opens for the current core-data snapshot. Pending opens share that page's request; completed reopens read the
current published catalog without acquiring providers again. Explicit **Retry**
requests a new acquisition. Replacing core settings data, the page, agent, or
Gateway resets this request state. Core data reloads after configuration changes,
so the next picker open can discover models from newly configured providers.
Usable choices remain available when refresh fails.
This replaces the former five-minute automatic refresh policy; elapsed time alone
does not make a reopened Settings picker refresh. The Gateway shares concurrent
provider acquisition.

`preparedOnly: true` and `refresh: true` remain mutually exclusive.
The Gateway advertises these published-read and details controls as
`published-model-catalog`. Clients that require this contract must check the
capability before sending the new fields; an older Gateway requires an update
or restart, not a silent local fallback. The model CLI uses this contract for
`models list` and `models list --refresh`.

## Exec approvals

- When an exec request needs approval, the gateway broadcasts
  `exec.approval.requested`.
- Operator clients resolve by calling `exec.approval.resolve` (requires
  `operator.approvals`).
- For `host=node`, `exec.approval.request` must include `systemRunPlan`
  (canonical `argv`/`cwd`/`rawCommand`/session metadata). Requests missing
  `systemRunPlan` are rejected.
- After approval, forwarded `node.invoke system.run` calls reuse that
  canonical `systemRunPlan` as the authoritative command/cwd/session context.
- If a caller mutates `command`, `rawCommand`, `cwd`, `agentId`, or
  `sessionKey` between prepare and the final approved `system.run` forward,
  the gateway rejects the run instead of trusting the mutated payload.

## Agent delivery fallback

- `agent` requests can include `deliver=true` to request outbound delivery.
- `bestEffortDeliver=false` (the default) keeps strict behavior: unresolved or
  internal-only delivery targets return `INVALID_REQUEST`.
- `bestEffortDeliver=true` allows fallback to session-only execution when no
  external deliverable route can be resolved (for example internal/webchat
  sessions or ambiguous multi-channel configs).
- Final `agent` results may include `result.deliveryStatus` when delivery was
  requested, using the same `sent`, `suppressed`, `partial_failed`, and
  `failed` statuses documented for
  [`openclaw agent --json --deliver`](/cli/agent#json-delivery-status).
