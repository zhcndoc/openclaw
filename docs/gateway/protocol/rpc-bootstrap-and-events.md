How a client bootstraps a session list in one call, the common gateway event families, and the node helper and exec lifecycle contracts.

## Session list bootstrap

Call `sessions.subscribe` with a non-empty `sessions.list` parameter object, such
as `{ limit: 60, ownerFirst: true }`, to subscribe and load the initial roster in
one request. A successful WebSocket response has the payload
`{ subscribed: true, list }`, where `list` is the normal `SessionsListResult`.
Calling with `{}` preserves the acknowledgment-only response
`{ subscribed: true }` and does not read a snapshot.
List parameters select the snapshot; they do not filter the connection's session
event subscription.

List views can pass `rowMode: "compact"` to omit repeated detail-only metadata:
`contextWindows`, `contextWindowDefault`, `thinkingLevels`, `thinkingOptions`,
`thinkingDefault`, `toolOverrides`, `providerReview`, `nativeRuntimeConsent`,
`contextBudgetStatus`, `agentRuntime`, and `pluginExtensions`. Each returned row
carries `rowMode: "compact"`; those omissions mean the detail was not requested,
and must not clear previously admitted detail fields. Use `sessions.describe`
or the full `chat.history.sessionInfo` for details. Omitting `rowMode` preserves
the full row contract. Title, preview, and Activity recap enrichment remain
controlled by their existing include flags.

Control UI list requests use compact rows and a bounded diagnostic `source`:
`sidebar`, `dashboard`, `activity`, `sessions-page`, `chat-pane`, `agent-roster`,
`command-palette`, or `skill-workshop`.
The source does not change selection or access. List and event rows include
`hasBoard`, the prepared dashboard-membership fact, so a dashboard gallery can
apply row updates without enumerating its pages again. Expanding a compact row
on the Sessions page reads its full details with `sessions.describe`.
Rows also carry `childOwnerSessionKeys`, the current retained owners used by the
Gateway's `spawnedBy` filter. These receipts include runtime-controller and
navigation ownership, expire through that same owner, and let child windows
apply events without reimplementing retention rules in the browser.

The Gateway registers the subscription before projecting the list. Clients must
listen for `sessions.changed` before making the request: events can arrive while
the snapshot is being built. Reconcile those events with the response and issue
a trailing `sessions.list` refresh when needed, including when an event only
invalidates the cached list. Reconnects require a new subscription and snapshot.

The Gateway keeps durable session metadata in memory and finishes its initial
row materialization before normal startup completes. Reconnecting clients can
read the initial roster as soon as the Gateway is ready. Committed owner changes
refresh affected rows incrementally; responses consume current row facts without
a staleness window. Keyed descriptions,
resolution, and chat startup prepare their requested row without waiting for the
bulk refresh. Newly admitted or replaced stores load their metadata once, and
rows disappear when their store leaves the current topology. Each response
applies the current viewer's visibility and current activity time. Equivalent
viewers share immutable row presentations and encoded row bytes until their
projection facts change; `snapshotAt` retains the row's sampling time. Runtime
authority, permission changes, and clock-expiring facts are checked before reuse.
WebSocket views of the same identity, sharing policy, and query also share
selection and facets within the current row publication. Queries that depend on
live runs, a clock window, child retention, or search select again for each read.
Every read presents current rows; unchanged rows share their array and assembled
JSON bytes. In-process callers retain their own selection and row wrappers for
authorized enrichment.

Resident rows use stored titles and usage. Optional message previews and terminal
fallback-model metadata fill in through bounded read-only background transcript
reads; they can be absent from an early response. Foreground requests take priority.
These reads do not restore cold archives, parse oversized messages, call a model,
or change stored metadata or session activity ordering. Missing historical titles
and legacy ACP keys are repaired only by `openclaw doctor --fix`. Missing usage
remains absent until the normal usage writer records it.

Both methods accept `activeOnly: true` to select currently running or queued sessions before pagination. Activity comes from the live runtime owners, not a stored status flag. Ordinary listing behavior is unchanged when the option is omitted or false. Active-only results include each visible agent-owned `global` and `unknown` session with its raw key and captured `agentId`; callers identify rows by agent, key, and `sessionId` together. Literal `agent:<id>:global` and `agent:<id>:unknown` sessions remain different rows. Active-only raw sentinel rows omit the optional `childSessions` and `hasActiveSubagentRun` fields; use `hasActiveRun` for direct activity. Normal permissions, archive/inclusion filters, and page limits still apply. Sessionless/internal runs are outside the session index.

Both methods accept `ownerFirst: true` to prepend up to 60 matching viewer-owned
rows (or `limit`, when smaller) to the normal first page, deduplicated by session key. This applies only
when `offset` is zero or omitted; later pages use normal pagination. Owned rows
must pass the same visibility and list filters as the shared page. The Gateway
resolves the viewer from the authenticated connection; no client-supplied
identity selects these rows. Without an authenticated viewer identity, or when
`ownerFirst` is false or omitted, the list uses normal ordering.

The shared page still determines `limitApplied`, `offset`, `nextOffset`,
`hasMore`, and `totalCount`. Prepended rows can make `sessions.length` and `count`
exceed the shared page size. Use `nextOffset` to advance and deduplicate rows by
session key across pages; do not derive the next offset from the displayed row
count.

## Session message subscriptions and narration

`sessions.messages.subscribe` subscribes one connection to a session's live
messages. Its `key` and optional `agentId` select the session; this is separate
from the broad roster subscription above. Omit `mode` for full `chat` and `agent`
streams, including foreground transcripts and passive views of runs started by
another client. Repeating a request replaces that observer's subscription mode.
`sessions.messages.unsubscribe` removes the observer identified by the same
optional `subscriptionId`; omission selects the legacy observer.
The subscribe acknowledgment includes the canonical `key` and resolved `agentId`.
Clients retain the resolved owner for later `global` requests, whose key alone
does not identify an agent. The SDK sends a stable opaque `subscriptionId` for
each wire observer and includes it in resubscriptions and unsubscribe requests.
For multiple IDs on one connection and session, full-stream interest takes
precedence until its last owner releases; approvals remain enabled while any
owner requests them. Omitting the ID retains the legacy single-observer behavior.
Older clients remain compatible with the updated Gateway; the updated SDK's
ownership fields require an updated Gateway.

Background narration consumers declare `mode: "narration"`. The Gateway replaces
their token-level `chat` deltas and raw `agent` assistant events with
`session.narration` snapshots. Each snapshot contains `sessionKey`, optional
`agentId`, `runId`, and `text`: at most 16,384 characters of the current visible
assistant tail. Hidden reasoning and internal context are removed before the
tail is bounded. An empty `text` retracts the previous narration. Consumers can
derive a compact line from this text without reconstructing token deltas.

The first text update can arrive immediately. Subsequent snapshots arrive at
most once every two seconds per session per connection, using the latest text
without postponing the pending deadline. Terminal chat events flush the last
snapshot immediately before the terminal event, including final text corrections
or retractions; this final flush is exempt from the two-second interval.
Newer tool activity or a change of run discards pending older text, so a delayed
snapshot cannot replace a newer tool line or switch the sidebar back to an older run.
Lifecycle, status, tool, final, abort, and error events retain their existing
delivery. Raw thinking streams and in-progress preamble or answer-candidate text
are omitted; item completion and answer selection still arrive. Approval events
still require `includeApprovals: true` and the normal
approval authority. Queued narration is discarded on unsubscribe, mode changes,
connection retirement, or run retirement, and delivery rechecks current access.

The Gateway client SDK shares matching session addresses among local owners.
The Gateway also combines independently identified observers that resolve to the
same subscription key. If any owner requires full streams, delivery remains
full; it returns to narration only after the last full owner releases it.
Narration consumers sharing a foreground subscription must also accept full
stream events. The Control UI waits for foreground admission before fetching
history, so the snapshot covers activity emitted before full streams were enabled.

The bundled Control UI declares narration intent for sidebar interests. It is
version-locked to its Gateway and reloads on upgrade. Shared Apple chat clients
use the default full mode for foreground sessions; Android and the TUI retain
their broad event delivery. Existing SDK callers and older clients that omit
`mode` retain full streams. Custom UI roots, development UIs, and cross-origin
UIs exempt from build admission can therefore retain full-stream narration until
updated. This is an additive protocol-v4 contract, with no capability negotiation
or protocol-version change.

## Common event families

- `chat`: UI chat updates such as `chat.inject` and other transcript-only chat
  events. A `state: "delta"` payload carries the append in `deltaText`.
  The first text frame delivered to a recipient for a run also includes the
  complete `message` snapshot, including when that recipient attaches mid-run
  or reconnects. Later append frames omit `message`. A supplied snapshot is
  authoritative and already includes `deltaText`; do not append the delta twice.
  Non-prefix replacements set `replace=true` and use `deltaText` as the entire
  replacement text, including an empty string to clear it. Replacements and
  canvas or media changes that require a new baseline include a complete snapshot.
  Clients retain non-text message blocks across ordinary text appends. Final,
  aborted, and error events retain their existing complete-message and intentional
  message-omission semantics. Pending appends are concatenated in order; tool and
  terminal boundaries flush pending text before settlement.
  Failed runs (`state: "error"`) may include `errorDetail` alongside the coarse
  `errorKind` and human-readable `errorMessage`. This closed object has seven
  optional fields: `provider`, `model`, `failoverReason`,
  `providerRuntimeFailureKind`, `providerErrorType`, `httpStatus`, and
  `providerErrorMessagePreview`. Strings are capped at 300 characters; `httpStatus`
  is an integer from 100 through 599. Details come from the failed attempt's
  sanitized provider observation, not from reparsing the user-facing message.
  The preview is credential-redacted and may be shorter than the protocol cap.
  Raw bodies, raw previews, and diagnostic hashes are never included in
  `errorDetail`. Runs without provider observations omit it; successful and
  canceled events do not carry it. This is an additive protocol-v4 field.
- `agent`: assistant text events use `data.delta` for appends. Optional `data.text`
  is an authoritative snapshot of that assistant item and already includes the
  delta. The first delivered text event, replacement/item boundaries, and media
  updates retain snapshots where needed. Honor `data.replace`, including empty
  replacements, and keep assistant item text separate from the display-projected
  `chat` stream. Subscribe to one text projection for a display; consuming both
  streams into one accumulator duplicates output. In-process agent observers
  retain their cumulative-text contract.
  A client that renders assistant text solely from `chat` can advertise
  `chat-only-assistant-text` in its connect `caps`. The Gateway then omits
  text-bearing `agent` events with `stream: "assistant"` from that connection,
  including foreground and background narration subscriptions. Other agent
  streams (tools, items, usage, run status, lifecycle, plans, and approvals),
  assistant events without text, and the `chat` stream are unchanged. Filtered
  frames do not consume connection sequence numbers. Clients without the
  capability keep both projections; native clients that display current-item
  agent text separately from cumulative chat text should not advertise it.
- `session.message`, `session.operation`, `session.tool`: transcript, in-flight
  session operation, and event-stream updates for a subscribed session.
- `session.narration`: bounded assistant-text snapshots for subscriptions with
  narration intent, paced and settled as described above.
- `session.approval`: sanitized pending and terminal approval truth for an
  explicitly opted-in exact-session subscriber. Child approvals use the
  persisted ancestor audience; events never mutate transcripts or wake agents.
- `session.observer`: safe live session headline and status digest. A model-authored
  preamble can update the headline immediately; utility-model assessments replace
  it later when available. Web, iOS, and Android use the same run-scoped digest.
  Utility-model replies may wrap the JSON digest in one plain or `json` Markdown
  fence; surrounding prose and invalid digest fields are rejected. If repeated
  invalid replies disable the observer for a run, the warning includes a redacted,
  whitespace-collapsed prefix of the last rejected reply, capped at 160 characters.
  The optional `sessionId` and opaque `lifecycleRevision` identify the session
  lifecycle; `lifecycleRevision` can be absent before the first reset. Revisions
  increase across runs within that lifecycle but can restart after a reset.
  `/clear` preserves `sessionId` and changes `lifecycleRevision`.
  Clients show its headline or inspector link only while the digest's exact `runId`
  is present in `activeRunIds`.
- `sessions.changed`: session index or metadata changed. Keyed changes carry the
  affected row in `session`, presented for that connection. Nested rows in
  `sessions.changed` and `session.message` use the same full prepared metadata,
  viewer permissions, and clock as `sessions.list` with title, last-message,
  and activity-summary enrichment enabled. This adds catalog-backed fields such
  as thinking options and replaces legacy model aliases with canonical model IDs
  in event rows. The Control UI applies these rows locally to existing roster
  members, so their values match the list. An explicit model, account, or runtime
  selection can also mark the event with `catalogChanged: true`.
  Full rows can include `sessionModelRevision`, which changes with saved model,
  account, runtime, and lifecycle inputs, independently of title and activity.
  Visible Control UI panes retain matching model catalogs and refresh changed
  selections immediately. Missing revisions and explicit `catalogChanged` hints
  still invalidate the catalog. Session events retain the agent's command list;
  `chat.metadata.changed` invalidates commands unless `commandsChanged: false`.
  Usage-only and model-only publications leave commands available without another
  metadata RPC.
  Top-level lifecycle and capacity fields
  remain event receipts, including explicit clearing values. When a nested row
  omits an optional field, honor its top-level clearing tombstone; nested values
  take precedence when present. Merge an existing
  roster member's snapshot locally when the query's membership and pagination
  window remain valid. The Control UI reuses lifecycle and ordinary `patch`,
  `participants`, `placement`, `send`, `steer`, `agent.run.started`, `agent.input.settled`, `run-capacity`, and
  `chat.title` snapshots for held rows with unchanged identity, archive,
  pin, owner, and parent facts and nondecreasing recency. Keyed `sessions.changed`
  and `session.message` publications also carry `ancestorSessions`, an array of
  full rows for the affected navigation, control, requester, and swarm ancestors,
  and may carry `ancestorSessionRefs` for unchanged ancestor presentations already
  delivered on that connection. References never appear inside `ancestorSessions`.
  The projection walks existing parent references up to the roots,
  deduplicates physical row identities, and stops cycles. Each ancestor passes
  the same per-viewer visibility filter and presentation as `sessions.list`;
  invisible intermediates do not prevent delivery of visible ancestors above them.
  The two arrays together contain at most 64 ancestors. If an ancestor cannot be
  resolved or the traversal exceeds that bound, both fields are omitted so clients
  retain authoritative refresh behavior. The presence of `ancestorSessions`
  certifies complete visible ancestor coverage across both arrays; an empty array
  certifies no visible ancestors only when `ancestorSessionRefs` is also absent or
  empty. These are additive protocol-v4 fields; they do not change subscription
  scope or list membership and require no capability negotiation.
  Full ancestor rows carry an opaque `ancestorRevision`; each reference contains
  `key`, `revision`, and `snapshotAt`, with `sessionId` and `agentId` when present
  on the full row. Before adding the revision tag, the Gateway compares the exact
  connection-specific presented row, excluding only `snapshotAt`. A reference
  certifies that the presentation identified by `revision` remains unchanged.
  Clients retain a referenced row only when they still hold that exact admitted
  presentation with matching identity, then advance its clock without changing
  its other facts. The Control UI binds the revision to the immutable admitted
  row only after confirming that its facts match the full presented row. A list
  replacement or local row change loses that proof, even if its sampling clock
  happens to match. Missing rows, generation or revision mismatches, and uncertain
  presentation ownership require the existing authoritative refresh path.
  The Gateway bounds this per-connection record and sends full rows after first
  delivery, a successful list read, reconnect, resubscribe, reset/delete, changed presentation or visibility,
  eviction, or uncertain delivery. Unsubscribe and disconnect clear the record;
  session deletion invalidates remembered ancestors.
  Recap-only (`reason: "activity-summary"`) events keep their ancestor payloads,
  but full rows in those events retire the corresponding reference records:
  shared rosters may skip recap admission. The next ordinary event supplies full
  rows again; unchanged references already held by the client remain reusable.
  Older web clients ignore the additive reference field. Because `ancestorSessions`
  contains full rows only, they cannot apply a reference as a partial row and erase
  held fields. Missing ancestor snapshots cause their existing authoritative
  `sessions.list` refresh. Bundled same-origin Control UI build admission prevents
  version skew; custom roots, development UIs, and cross-origin clients can use
  this correct but slower path. Native Apple and Android clients, the TUI, and
  the SDK do not reconcile ancestor rows and retain their existing behavior.
  Clients apply the child and held full ancestor rows together, honoring each row's
  identity and clock. In full snapshots, omitted optional row facts
  clear previously held values, including child links, swarm summaries, and
  descendant-running flags. Non-null legacy top-level row fields do not fill
  omissions in a complete, viewer-filtered row. Explicit null clearing receipts
  and separate lifecycle receipts remain effective. The existing optional title/preview enrichment and
  thinking-metadata preservation rules still apply.
  The Control UI coalesces an authoritative
  refresh for missing rows or snapshots, broad/keyless changes, `catalogChanged`,
  filters whose membership cannot be established from row facts, incomplete ancestor snapshots, and uncertain boundaries (including owner-first rows
  promoted into the shared page). Events overlapping a roster read retain a
  trailing refresh so its response cannot lose an update. A retained list with a
  read error also refreshes on the next relevant event. Profile identity, runner
  availability, and loaded cron bindings can produce broad invalidations.
  Activity-summary-only publications update opted-in Activity consumers; shared
  session and agent rosters do not refetch for those recap-only changes.
  Held row updates preserve unfiltered and dashboard-filtered windows without
  refetching; title and preview enrichment flags do not change membership.
  Healthy row traffic retains one fallback read after at least 60 seconds.
  Dashboard pagination belongs to the shared roster window, which keeps loaded
  pages across row updates and coalesces simultaneous reads for the same query.
  Child windows use the Gateway's ownership receipts and complete parent child
  lists. Certified excluded ancestor rows can be skipped; references require an
  admitted current row from the connection's shared provenance owner.
  The sidebar owner-count facet also retains its aggregate when admitted old and
  new row facts prove unchanged contributions. Running state, ownership, sharing,
  archive, or uncertain filter changes still require an authoritative count read.
  Prepared row publications yield between bounded slices during bursts. Pending
  activity-summary updates for the same session generation share the latest
  snapshot; lifecycle, capacity, transcript, deletion, and clearing receipts remain
  distinct. Publication rechecks row readiness after each yield. Accepted recap
  notifications outlive the compaction or scheduler work that triggered them.
  Shutdown stops new notifications and joins admitted publications before closing
  clients and disposing their projection.
  Authorized incognito descriptions and events use the same row presentation from
  transient process-local state. Incognito rows remain excluded from the session
  roster, and queued events cannot cross a reset or database replacement.
  Tool/progress events keep delivering while rows refresh; their optional row
  metadata can be absent until ready. Full roster rows remain guaranteed on
  keyed `sessions.changed` and `session.message` snapshots.
  Active-run fields use the
  same aggregate and complete-exact semantics as `sessions.list`; `activeRunIds: null`
  clears cached exact identities to unavailable, omission leaves the cache unchanged,
  and an array replaces it. Delete notifications from `sessions.delete` and incognito
  reset carry the removed generation's `sessionId`, without a current-row snapshot.
  Clients must not delete a replacement with a different ID. A key-only delete event
  or a rowless global notification invalidates the canonical session list; it does
  not identify the current generation as deleted.
- `presence`: system presence snapshot updates.
- `tick`: periodic keepalive/liveness event.
- `health`: gateway health snapshot update.
- `heartbeat`: heartbeat event stream update.
- `cron`: cron run/job change event.
- `shutdown`: gateway shutdown notification.
- `node.pair.requested` / `node.pair.resolved`: node pairing lifecycle.
- `node.invoke.request`: node invoke request broadcast.
- `device.pair.requested` / `device.pair.resolved`: paired-device approval lifecycle.
- `device.pair.setup.completed`: exact setup-code handoff completion, scoped to
  `operator.pairing`.
- `device.pair.setup.deliveryUncertain`: replay-safe setup-code retirement whose
  credential response delivery could not be confirmed, scoped to `operator.pairing`.
- `voicewake.changed`: wake-word trigger config changed.
- `plugins.changed`: plugin runtime publication completed. The payload is
  `{ generation }`; refresh `plugins.list` to reconcile installed and runtime state.
- `config.changed`: a config write persisted (payload carries the config path,
  the new snapshot hash, and a timestamp — never config content). Operator-read
  scoped; clients refresh via `config.get`.
- `skills.changed`: connectivity, the skill catalog, config, or eligibility
  changed after the gateway invalidated its skills snapshot. The payload's
  `reason` is `watch`, `watch-targets`, `manual`, `remote-node`,
  `config-change`, or `workshop`. Operator-read scoped; clients refresh via
  `skills.status`.
- `exec.approval.requested` / `exec.approval.resolved`: exec approval
  lifecycle.
- `plugin.approval.requested` / `plugin.approval.resolved`: plugin approval
  lifecycle.

## Node helper methods

Nodes may call `skills.bins` to fetch the current list of skill executables
for auto-allow checks.

## Node exec lifecycle events

Nodes report `system.run` lifecycle through the node-role `node.event` RPC with
`event: "exec.started"`, `"exec.finished"`, or `"exec.denied"`. These are not the
operator `exec.approval.*` broadcasts and do not use the retired TCP bridge.

The RPC accepts a JSON string in `payloadJSON` or an object in `payload`. A string
`payloadJSON` takes precedence when both are supplied. For example:

```json
{
  "event": "exec.finished",
  "payload": {
    "sessionKey": "agent:main:main",
    "runId": "<exec-run-id>",
    "host": "node",
    "exitCode": 0,
    "timedOut": false,
    "success": true,
    "output": "done"
  }
}
```

Current headless nodes include `sessionKey`, `runId`, and `host: "node"`.
Additional fields are:

| Field                  | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `command`              | Raw or formatted command text.                               |
| `exitCode`, `timedOut` | Process completion code and timeout flag.                    |
| `success`              | Producer result flag, not the notification-gating predicate. |
| `output`               | Bounded combined stdout, stderr, and error text.             |
| `reason`               | Denial reason for `exec.denied`.                             |
| `suppressNotifyOnExit` | Suppress this invocation's system notification.              |

Echo the correlation fields forwarded with `system.run`; neither an ID nor the
payload's `host` field grants authority. The Gateway matches the authenticated
node and connection, run ID, and session key when the invocation binds one.
Unmatched events return `handled: false` with `reason: "unmatched_exec_event"` and
produce no system notification. A narrow legacy macOS-client path may match a
missing or mismatched run ID only to one unambiguous invocation on that
connection/session; new clients must send the issued run ID.

`exec.started` retains the authorization record; `exec.finished` and
`exec.denied` consume it before notification filtering. `tools.exec.notifyOnExit:
false` or `suppressNotifyOnExit: true` suppresses notifications. Denied events
never enqueue a system event or wake agent work. Finished events notify only for
timeout, nonzero or unknown exit code, or nonempty compacted output; successful
exit 0 with no output stays quiet. Finished notifications with a run ID are
deduplicated by canonical session and run ID. A heartbeat wake is requested only
after a system event is queued.

Node event delivery is best-effort, not a durable completion ledger.
