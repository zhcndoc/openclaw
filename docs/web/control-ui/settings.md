---

Everything under Settings, plus the settings-owned pages the sidebar links to.

**Back to app** returns to the workspace page you were using before opening Settings, including its selected session and URL filters. Escape does the same when an editor or dialog is not using that key. Moving between Settings pages does not change the return destination.

Use **Search settings** to find pages and configuration fields. Search for **Typography**, **font**, or **Chat prose** to jump to the Interface and Chat prose font controls in Appearance. Authored schema tags remain searchable with `tag:<name>` but are not displayed as field badges. Tags are not inferred from setting names, sensitivity, or complexity. For a field authored with a `storage` tag, combine it with text such as `Log tag:storage File`. Multiple tags require a field to match every tag.

Model menus with more than eight choices include search. Filter by model name or provider/model reference, then choose a result to apply it. Typing or dismissing the menu leaves the current selection unchanged. Short menus stay compact, and custom model entry remains available where the setting supports it.

When the Gateway rejects an invalid setting, **Settings not applied** keeps your draft and offers **Show reason**, **Retry**, and **Discard draft and reload**. Discard removes all unsaved configuration edits and reloads the saved settings. Clearing a text field is an edit, not a discard: settings that accept an empty string keep that explicit value.

Global model defaults apply to every agent. Switching the Settings agent while saving does not change the save target. If a save fails, **Retry** resubmits that change; after recovery, the controls follow the saved configuration, including later updates from another client.

Configuration edits, including reverting a value while a save is pending, survive refreshes and reconnects. If a save's outcome is unknown, the UI keeps your draft and pauses unrelated settings writes until a refresh confirms the saved revision or you explicitly retry the save or discard the draft. Even when a reverted draft looks unchanged, the save indicator keeps **Retry** available and prevents managed UI reloads from losing the unresolved draft. **Retry** repeats the failed Save or Apply operation. Seeing the old saved value after reconnect does not confirm that an earlier write has stopped; the UI keeps the uncertainty visible so a later commit cannot erase your revert. Changes from another writer retain the original draft and report a conflict instead of silently replacing your edits. Raw-editor drafts remain manual-save-only.

An unsettled Save or Apply stays bound to its original Gateway. Switching Gateways does not transfer that pending change: reconnect to the original Gateway to retry it, or discard the retained draft before editing the new Gateway.

In **Models**, **Connect provider** offers the credential-only sign-in methods declared by installed provider plugins. Connecting saves the credential without selecting its starter model. If model restrictions hide the provider, choose **Show all provider models** or **Keep current restrictions**; saving a credential alone does not widen access. Choose **Models → Connect provider → On this Gateway** to find existing connections or open [setup and explicit model activation](/start/onboarding). Saving credentials does not activate a model; testing and using a model remains a separate choice for the selected agent. If saving has already started, cancellation keeps the dialog open until the saved result arrives. Leaving the page closes pending sign-in input and lets an active save finish, so a later sign-in can start without losing saved credentials.

Model pickers show the authentication methods available to the selected agent. A single subscription or an explicitly selected account includes its email when available; multiple accounts and mixed API/subscription credentials are shown without guessing which account will run. **Utility Model → Auto** also shows the recommended small model derived from the global primary model, including an explicit account selection inherited from that model. Providers without a recommended small model say so. Agent-specific overrides still take precedence when the agent runs.

## Environment identity

When you run several Gateways, set `gateway.controlUi.environment` to distinguish their browser tabs and windows:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    controlUi: {
      environment: { label: "edge", color: "amber" },
    },
  },
}
```

The environment adds a 2 px top stripe, an agent-avatar ring, label pills in the sidebar and narrow topbar, a browser-title suffix, and a matching favicon. The label is trimmed and must contain 1–24 characters. Available colors are `teal`, `amber`, `purple`, `coral`, `pink`, `blue`, `green`, `red`, and `gray`. The label and color are intentionally visible before sign-in; leave `environment` unset to keep the standard appearance unchanged.

## Community invitation

The sidebar shows a Discord community invitation by default. Its first appearance waits until sidebar interaction finishes, so it does not move session controls while you use them. Its close button dismisses it for the current browser origin. To hide the invitation for everyone using a Control UI deployment, run this on the Gateway serving that UI:

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.communityInvite false
```

After the Gateway applies the change, reload the browser page or reconnect to pick it up. The setting belongs to the Gateway serving the UI, including when that UI connects to a different remote Gateway. Setting it to `false` hides the card even in new browser profiles. Re-enabling it with `true` preserves existing browser-local dismissals.

## Personal identity

Authenticated people have a durable Gateway profile with a display name, avatar, linked emails, and optional verified GitHub identity. Open **Settings → Profile → Identity** to update the editable fields. The profile follows the authenticated person across browsers; clearing browser site data does not delete it.

Profile photos load through authenticated Gateway routes in the online roster, person cards, and chat. Paired browsers use their approved read scopes. When the Mac app connects through an SSH tunnel to a trusted-proxy Gateway, image requests can use the connection's saved password if its paired credential is rejected. Credentials stay in request headers; profiles without an available image show initials.

On a single-user Gateway, unidentified operators share one durable owner profile across devices, including device-token reconnects. Its unset display name is seeded from the Gateway host account's full name, never its login name; saved names are never overwritten. Without a full name, the sidebar shows **Owner**. With `gateway.roles` configured, only token/password connections receive this owner profile; other unidentified connections see an explanation in Identity instead of editing controls. The owner profile has no email and grants no additional permissions.

On macOS, the owner's avatar defaults to the Gateway host account's user picture when no OpenClaw avatar is saved. This uses the Mac running the Gateway, including when you connect from another device. A saved avatar always takes priority. OpenClaw reads the picture locally and serves a resized copy through the authenticated avatar route; other people's profiles never inherit it. Restart the Gateway to pick up a changed macOS picture. If the picture cannot be read, initials remain visible.

**Settings → Profile → Connected accounts** shows the selected **Gateway**, saved **Person**, and **Scope: Personal**. Choose **Add account**, then a provider and sign-in method from the Gateway's catalog. Browser/device sign-in, protected credential inputs, progress, and cancellation use one guided flow. These are the same personal accounts managed by `openclaw models accounts login`, not the machine-local system/agent credentials managed by `models auth`. Account controls follow the Gateway-assigned profile, including the shared owner profile on a single-user Gateway. If the connection has no profile, the section explains the missing identity and offers **Connection settings** without showing provider credential inputs. Shared Gateway tokens and device pairing alone do not distinguish people on a multi-user Gateway. See [Per-person model accounts](/concepts/multi-user#per-person-model-accounts).

GitHub-backed sign-in through Cloudflare Access or Tailscale Serve fills the read-only **GitHub account** row with the verified public avatar and account link without replacing a custom OpenClaw avatar. **Git co-author credit** is a separate toggle, on by default for verified accounts, that controls future commits from shared sessions. See [User model](/concepts/user-model#gateway-profile-and-github-credit) for verification, retry, account-change, noreply privacy, and eligibility rules.

**Settings → Profile → GitHub connections** separately shows **My GitHub** and **System GitHub**. Identified people, including read-scoped operators, can connect and disconnect only their own account; administrators can also change the shared System account. Connecting defaults to **For me** for identified users and never changes their sign-in identity, co-author preference, or shared execution defaults. Personal credentials support explicit Gateway-brokered **Publish PR** actions, not ordinary agent shell commands. See [GitHub connections](/concepts/user-model#github-connections).

Administrators also see the default agent's effective GitHub account and verification status here. **View agent account** opens **Agent settings → Tools → GitHub account**, where any agent's account source, credential type, OAuth expiry, and refresh state are available. Authenticated [GitHub Actions widgets](/tools/show-widget#read-github-actions-runs) use this effective agent account. **Verified** confirms the account with GitHub; repository permissions are checked on each data request.

Credentials reserved for Control UI link previews are excluded from both agent authentication and its displayed status, including when the preview credential uses a SecretRef.

Set an agent's display name, emoji, and avatar under **Agent settings → Overview → Identity**. The identity is stored with that agent and is shared by Control UI clients. Where the transcript shows avatars, saved and streaming assistant replies use the configured agent image or text avatar. Agents without a configured avatar omit the repeated fallback icon.

In **Agent settings → Files**, an unread file stays unavailable for editing and preview until its content loads. If the initial read fails, choose **Refresh** to retry. Files already loaded and retained drafts stay editable during refresh; **Reset** becomes available once the current file content loads. Unsaved edits stay with their agent when you switch file tabs or select another agent and return. Returning reads the current file from disk while preserving your edits; if the file changed elsewhere, saving keeps the existing conflict recovery choices. These drafts live only in the open Agents settings page: save before leaving the page, reloading the browser, or changing Gateway connections. An ordinary reconnect preserves them.

Elsewhere, agents without a custom image or emoji use a generated face that fills the circular avatar. Its color, eyes, mouth, and solid or pastel background come from the agent ID, so the same agent keeps the same face across reloads and clients. Renaming the agent's display name does not change its face. Generated faces are decorative and do not indicate activity or model choice.

## Gateway host status

The connection settings use one **Gateway secret** field for the configured
token or password. The Gateway accepts either wire field; its auth mode selects
the configured secret. After a successful token-mode connection, the UI remembers
the secret in session storage for the current browser tab and Gateway only.
Passwords stay in memory and are never persisted.

**Settings → Gateway** shows **Connected** without a Connect action when the
connection is healthy and unchanged. Editing the URL or secret reveals **Apply
and reconnect** and **Discard changes**. While a connection attempt is running,
unchanged settings show a disabled **Connecting…** or **Reconnecting…** action.
Editing the URL or secret enables **Apply and reconnect**, so you can replace a
connection that is stuck retrying. A disconnected connection offers **Connect**
or **Retry connection**.
Open **Connection details** for authentication and heartbeat information, or use
its **Reconnect** action to troubleshoot the current connection.

The separate **Session** section saves the **Default session** for the current
Gateway in this browser without reconnecting. Session edits and connection edits
have independent Save/Apply and Discard actions. Switching Gateways restores
that Gateway's saved session selection.

Open **Settings → Gateway** to see the **Gateway Host** card with the Gateway machine, LAN address, operating system, runtime, uptime, CPU load, memory, and space for each mounted local disk. Linux EFI boot partitions mounted at `/boot/efi` or `/efi` are omitted. The card shares a ten-second `system.info` refresh with the activity graphs while visible; mounted-disk discovery and state-directory disk space reuse thirty-second snapshots. Machine name, CPU count, and CPU model are sampled once when the Gateway process starts; restart the Gateway to reflect CPU topology changes. Process counters, load averages, and event-loop health stay live on every request. Linux disk sampling reads filesystem statistics directly and does not require the `df` utility. The RPC requires the `operator.read` scope. If mounted-disk discovery is unavailable, the card retains the state-directory disk reading when available. Connections without the required scope omit the card. Shimmer placeholders appear while the first stats are being fetched and remain still with reduced motion enabled; refreshes keep the previous readings and uptime visible. Disk paths appear in their labels without duplicate tooltips.

The **Connection** card also shows average ping and p50, p95, and p99 round-trip
times in milliseconds. It samples every ten seconds while the page is visible
and summarizes the last 100 successful samples from the current connection.
The sample count makes small sets visible; p95 and p99 become more useful as
samples accumulate. Reconnecting, switching Gateways, or leaving the page resets
the readings. Failed requests are excluded and shown as a retry notice.

The ping graph shows individual round trips. **Gateway activity** uses the same
CPU, process memory, and event-loop delay graphs as the debug overlay, with up to
100 snapshots sampled every ten seconds while visible. CPU includes event-loop
utilization, memory shows process RSS and used heap, and delay shows the Gateway's
event-loop p99 and maximum delay. These are Gateway process measurements, separate
from connection ping and the machine-wide **Gateway Host** readings below.
Gateway, Appearance, Devices, Systems, and System busyness share status reads for the same connection,
so opening the tray alongside Settings does not multiply `system.info` traffic.
Hidden tabs pause these reads and resume when visible. Cached samples retain their
original timestamp and measured round-trip time.
Activity polling reads process counters through `system.info`, without running
the full task and session inspection used by the operator `status` report.

Ping measures a lightweight `last-heartbeat` request over the existing WebSocket,
including Gateway request handling. It is not ICMP ping or model response time.

## Language support

The Control UI localizes itself on first load based on your browser locale. To override it later, open **Settings → Appearance → Language**.

- Supported locales: `en`, `ar`, `de`, `es`, `fa`, `fr`, `hi`, `id`, `it`, `ja-JP`, `ko`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt-BR`, `ru`, `th`, `tr`, `uk`, `vi`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`
- Non-English translations are lazy-loaded in the browser.
- The selected locale is saved in browser storage and reused on future visits.
- Missing translation keys fall back to English.

Docs translations are generated for the same non-English locale set. The custom docs website supports these locales, including Thai (`th`) and Persian (`fa`).

## Appearance themes

Ask the agent to list themes, choose one by name or description, or design and apply a new theme. The `theme` tool uses the same catalog and profile selection as Appearance. Plugin themes and agent-created personal themes appear alongside built-ins with their names and descriptions. Profile theme changes reach connected browsers live; plugin theme additions, updates, and removals take effect after plugin hot reload without restarting the Gateway or reloading the browser. If a selected plugin theme becomes unavailable, Claw renders temporarily and the selection returns when the theme is available again. A loading error in Appearance offers **Retry** to refresh the catalog and palette.

Personal theme definitions are saved to your authenticated Gateway profile. Existing browser-local tweakcn imports remain local and are never uploaded automatically. The agent reports a selection as saved; a browser that is offline applies it when it next connects. A theme that supplies only one color mode uses that mode even when the preference is System. Explicit accent and font overrides continue to take precedence over the theme.

The Appearance panel has the built-in Claw, Knot, Dash, Absolutely, Tide, Beacon, Phosphor, CRT, Manuscript, Rosé, and Miami themes (Claw is default), plus themes contributed by enabled plugins, personal themes saved through the agent, and one browser-local tweakcn import slot. Each theme ships its own self-hosted typeface, loaded only when selected or previewed: Claw uses Instrument Sans, Knot uses Geist, Dash pairs DM Sans with Fraunces for chat prose, Absolutely pairs Space Grotesk with Lora for chat prose, Tide uses IBM Plex Sans, Rosé uses DM Sans, and Miami uses Space Grotesk. Beacon targets WCAG AAA (7:1) contrast with the Atkinson Hyperlegible Next typeface for low vision, bright sunlight, projectors, and low-quality panels. Phosphor and CRT set the entire surface, chat prose included, in JetBrains Mono — Phosphor as green-on-glass, CRT as a white-on-black console with squared corners. Manuscript is the one light-first theme: parchment and iron-gall ink with a lapis accent, set entirely in the Lora serif, with a candlelit dark mode. To import a theme, open the [tweakcn editor](https://tweakcn.com/editor/theme), choose or create a theme, click **Share**, and paste the copied link into Appearance. The importer also accepts `https://tweakcn.com/r/themes/<id>` registry URLs, editor URLs like `https://tweakcn.com/editor/theme?theme=amethyst-haze`, relative `/themes/<id>` paths, raw theme IDs, and default theme names such as `amethyst-haze`.

Theme stylesheets can set `--chat-composer-corner-shape` (default `superellipse(1.5)`) to give the chat composer a different corner family, such as `scoop scoop round round`, in browsers that draw `corner-shape`; other browsers keep the circular corners.

Themes can choose a neutral prompt mark instead of the lobster mascot and supply their own long-wait status vocabulary. They can also add occasional penguin or fedora visitors to the composer ledge and occasional hats on agent avatars from the `fedora`, `crown`, `santa`, `party`, and `pumpkin` catalog. A theme without the mascot hides the resident lobster and visiting lobster strangers while ordinary ledge traffic continues under the unchanged **Lobster visits** toggle. See the [theme definition fields](/tools/theme#create-and-apply-a-personal-theme) for the portable settings and limits.

Plugin themes can also bring their own SVG hats and composer visitors through [declared artwork](/plugins/manifest/surfaces#themes).

Every built-in theme includes matching light and dark background artwork across the app canvas. The small, bundled lossless WebP images stay quiet behind content and follow the selected mode, including System. Plugin, personal, and imported palettes use neutral artwork. New-session and chat composers use a lightly translucent surface instead of repeating the image; navigation, menus, and reading cards retain their own surfaces. No external image requests are required. Increased contrast and forced colors hide the artwork and make composers opaque; reduced transparency also makes composers opaque.

Themes imported from tweakcn are stored only in the current browser profile; they are not written to gateway config and do not sync across devices. Replacing the imported theme updates the one local slot; clearing it switches back to Claw if the imported theme was active.

Selecting a **different theme** in Appearance applies its complete default look, clearing the interface and chat font overrides and selecting its own accent palette. You can customize the fonts and accent afterward. Selecting the same theme, reloading, reconnecting, receiving synced preferences, or changing light/dark mode does not reset those customizations. Language, text size, chat display, and other unrelated preferences are unchanged.

The mounted UI keeps a live display-preference snapshot for its connected Gateway. Local changes and same-Gateway browser-tab edits update open composers without a reload. Sidebar width, sidebar entries, and pinned agents also update across tabs; collapsing the sidebar stays local to each tab. Resizing the sidebar preserves pins and entries changed in another tab. Selecting a different Gateway in another tab does not retarget the current tab. Credentials remain owned by the connection, separate from this display snapshot.

Choose an **Accent color** preset or custom color in Appearance to override the active theme's accent. For an authenticated Gateway profile, the accent precedence is the profile's `ui.accent` preference, the gateway-wide `ui.prefs.accent` setting, the operator-configured `ui.seamColor`, and finally the active theme's default. A theme selection stores the explicit `"theme"` accent preference, which uses the selected theme's complete palette in both light and dark modes instead of inheriting gateway accent or seam colors. **Restore default** clears only that profile's preference, leaving the gateway-wide settings unchanged. Connections without an authenticated profile keep the existing gateway-wide preference behavior.

Existing unset and hex accents keep their meaning; upgrades do not migrate or reset saved preferences. Older Control UI readers that do not recognize the profile value `"theme"` fall back to inherited colors. Before downgrading to a Gateway whose `ui.prefs.accent` accepts only hex colors, remove a configured `"theme"` value or replace it with `#RRGGBB`. This adds no database schema version or preference key.

The **Typography** block lets you choose an **Interface** face and a separate **Chat prose** face. **Theme default** for both Interface and Chat prose restore the theme’s typography; Dash and Absolutely keep their own serif chat defaults. **System** uses the system sans-serif stack without loading a webfont. Code keeps its monospace stack. Opening either picker loads the self-hosted specimens on demand; startup loads only the active faces. Font overrides follow an authenticated Gateway profile, with a browser-local mirror for instant boot. Without a profile, they stay in that browser and are never written to `openclaw.json`.

Appearance also has a Text size setting. It applies to chat text, composer text, tool cards, and chat sidebars, and keeps text inputs at least 16px so mobile Safari does not auto-zoom on focus.

Appearance also carries the **Lobster visits** and **Lobster sounds** toggles and the Lobsterdex. Both toggles are browser-local. See [The Lobster](/web/lobster) for what the composer visitors do and how to turn them off for good.

When your connection is bound to an authenticated Gateway profile, theme, theme mode, and accent color are saved to that profile instead of the gateway config. They follow you across devices without changing anyone else's appearance, override gateway-wide `ui.prefs` values, and update your connected clients live. Connections without an authenticated profile continue syncing these preferences through the gateway config exactly as before. Language and chat display preferences remain gateway-config preferences for every connection. Each browser keeps a local mirror for instant boot, and text size remains browser-local. An explicitly read-only connection applies preference changes only in that browser. Changes made while offline remain queued until a later connection can write their applicable preferences; on a read-only reconnect, they continue to behave as browser-local preferences. See [Configuration reference](/gateway/configuration-reference#ui).

## Session sources

Open the sidebar's **Filter & sort** menu and choose **Session sources…** to
control automatic discovery of **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, and **Pi** conversations.
The same controls live in **Settings → Appearance → Session sources**; searching
Settings for the coding app's name and **sessions** opens them directly.

Only sources whose owning plugin is installed appear: **Anthropic** for Claude Code,
**Codex**, **OpenCode**, and **ACPX** for Pi. Installed but disabled plugins still expose
their discovery preference; the plugin must be enabled for discovery to run.

The **Show … sessions** switches control discovery on the Gateway and eligible paired
computers. They use each plugin's existing discovery
preference and apply to everyone on that Gateway. Changes save automatically and
require a Gateway restart. **Manage plugins** opens installation and enablement controls.
Pi uses ACPX's `piSessionCatalog.enabled` preference; the other sources use their plugin's
`sessionCatalog.enabled` preference. Disabling discovery leaves the provider
and harness settings unchanged.

Fresh installations start Claude Code and Codex discovery off. OpenCode and Pi currently
default to on. Existing installations retain their previous settings, including older
implicit-on defaults. **Hide from sidebar**
in a catalog's menu remains a separate browser-only presentation preference.

## Manage plugins

Open **Plugins** in the sidebar, or use `/settings/plugins` relative to the
configured Control UI base path, to browse and manage plugins without leaving
the Control UI. For example, a base path of `/openclaw` uses
`/openclaw/settings/plugins`. The page is always available, even when every
optional plugin is disabled.

The **Plugins** hub at `/plugins` browses the catalog. Its **Skills** and
**Skill workshop** tabs open the per-agent skill manager at `/skills` and Skill
Workshop at `/skills/workshop`. **Settings → Plugins** at `/settings/plugins`
shows the searchable local inventory. Select a plugin to open its overview.

Opening a plugin shows its description, publisher when available, skills, tools,
MCP servers, and full README on one overview. Select a tool to read its full
description. The metadata rail shows available release details, categories, repository, and
documentation. Security audits link to ClawHub.

Installed, disabled plugins put **Enable** first as the primary action, followed
by **Ask OpenClaw**. Enabled plugins put primary **Ask OpenClaw** first, followed
by **Disable**. Both rows then offer **Uninstall** when removable and an icon
button for **Settings**. Uninstalled plugins put **Install** first. **Install**
starts installation immediately and accepts the staged plugin’s declared
capabilities without changing your hook and model permissions. Configured
install-policy warnings still require an explicit acknowledgment. Installing from
a catalog overview keeps the same URL. Its progress popover shows the reported
steps and elapsed time, including runtime application. Installed actions appear
only after the Gateway returns the final result.
Ready new plugins become enabled; missing required configuration or an existing
disabled choice keeps them disabled. **Settings** opens an addressable
editor with plugin configuration and editable **Permissions** controls; Back returns
to the overview.
Existing `#configuration` links still open the editor. Local controls and the
installed README remain available when optional ClawHub metadata cannot load.
The catalog shows featured plugins and category shelves. Within each category,
ClawHub's selected priorities appear first, followed by remaining plugins in
download order. **View all** preserves that order. Computer use groups interactive
desktop and browser control. Other and uncategorized plugins remain available
through search and installed-plugin management instead of homepage sections.
Search queries
[ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/plugins) without leaving the page. Catalog detail
links use `/plugins/<catalog-id>`; installed-only links use
`/settings/plugins/<plugin-id>`. Both show the same overview and actions.

Open a skill on a plugin detail page to browse its complete declared folder. The
viewer starts with `SKILL.md`, includes unlinked files and nested folders, and
renders full Markdown documents. Files that cannot render, exceed the read
limits, or are unavailable remain visible with an explanation. Installed and
catalog plugins use the same viewer; catalog reads stay pinned to the selected
release and do not install or execute the plugin. This viewer has no search or
Copy controls. Reading a bundle requires `operator.read`.

The **Skills** tab keeps the skill status report, enable/disable toggles, API
key entry, and inline ClawHub skill search, scoped to the selected agent. The
**Skill workshop** tab shows installed skills and pending
[skill proposals](/tools/skill-workshop). **Learn from past conversations** opens
a normal session with the selected agent's configured model and permitted tools.
The agent chooses which history and skills to inspect, following the current
Workshop mode. Chat shows progress, results, and normal stop and follow-up controls.

Included plugins are already present on the Gateway and show **Enable** or
**Disable** instead of **Install**. For example, Workboard is included with
OpenClaw but disabled by default, so its action is **Enable**. Bundled plugins
cannot be removed, only disabled.

Reading the catalog and searching ClawHub require `operator.read`. Installing,
enabling, disabling, or removing a plugin and changing MCP servers require
`operator.admin`; those actions stay disabled for read-only operators.

Plugin-declared credential fields support masked key entry and an inline key-signup
link. The eye reveals the key you are entering. With no new key entered,
administrators can choose **Show API key** to retrieve the stored literal for that
field and current config revision. A revealed saved value is hidden again when
the field, configuration revision, or Gateway connection changes. Secret references
and environment values are never resolved or revealed. Leaving an empty input
unchanged preserves its existing credential.

Administrators can inspect and edit a declared credential's secret reference: its
source (`env`, `file`, `exec`, or `store`), provider alias, and identifier. The
Gateway returns that metadata only for the selected field and current config
revision, without resolving the secret. **Cancel** removes this field's unsaved
reference change, including after a rejected save, while preserving other edits.
If Cancel cannot reload the saved configuration, the dialog keeps the draft and
shows that read's error; background refreshes cannot replace the pending Cancel read.
**Save** waits for the existing Settings write to be acknowledged; the dialog
cannot be dismissed while that write is pending. If the saved value cannot be
confirmed, the dialog keeps the draft and displays the recovery error. Failed
writes retain the draft, and stale revisions require a fresh read. Read-only config
permits inspection but disables changes. Environment fallback is inspect-only:
change the variable at its source. Saving a reference does not rotate a secret or
verify a provider connection. Fields without declared credential metadata retain
the ordinary schema editor.

ClawHub installs run through the Gateway and keep the same trust, integrity,
and plugin-install policy checks as other Gateway-mediated installs. Install,
enable, disable, and remove actions wait for runtime application without
restarting the Gateway. Ordinary plugin config edits also apply automatically
in the default hybrid reload mode. See
[Apply changes and inspect](/plugins/manage-plugins#apply-changes-and-inspect)
for application failures, cleanup warnings, and source-edit reloads.
OAuth-backed MCP connectors need a one-time
`openclaw mcp login <name>` from the CLI after they are added.

The page intentionally focuses on inventory, discovery, install, enablement,
and removal. Use [`openclaw plugins`](/cli/plugins) for arbitrary npm, git, or
local-path sources, updates, and advanced plugin configuration.

## Updates

Open **Settings → Updates** (`/settings/updates`) to check the installed version,
update policy, and active or most recent update. **Update now** opens a
confirmation showing the target and restart impact. Choose **Update and restart**
to start; canceling leaves the Gateway untouched.

For `dev` git updates, the confirmation, sidebar, and available-update status
show the installed → target short commit SHAs on a separate line below the commit
count. **Compare on GitHub** opens a comparison when the tracked upstream is
a GitHub repository; other installs show plain revisions. This distinguishes
revisions that share a version number.
After a checkout refresh, the count, revisions, and comparison link describe the
same checked upstream. An automatic update campaign keeps its announced target;
its displayed comparison stays bound to that target. If the installed revision
has changed, the campaign shows its target without an outdated count or link.
Commit details from a different comparison stay hidden.

After confirmation, one update view shows the ordered phases, current or last
step details, and verification results for the service, version, plugins,
channels, and inference. The details area follows new lines until you scroll up.
The dialog stays open with **Gateway restarting…** while the connection is down.
After reconnecting, it reads the same run from the Gateway; reloading the page
also restores the active or latest run in Settings.

Every completed run keeps a report, including success. Failed runs retain
**Check status**, **Retry update**, and Triage recovery actions. The sidebar update
card shows the active phase and opens the same view. A completed run can appear
there for up to 24 hours until you acknowledge it in that browser.

The report is shared with chat and the CLI. See [Updating](/install/updating)
for installation-specific behavior and [Run history and reports](/cli/update#run-history-and-reports)
for inspecting a run from the Gateway host. In the signed macOS app, an app-owned
local Gateway still uses **Update Mac app + Gateway** and the native update flow.

## Apps and extensions

Open **Apps** from the sidebar **More** menu, the command palette, or the
sidebar agent menu (**Get the apps**), or use `/apps` relative to the
configured Control UI base path. The page collects install links for every
OpenClaw companion surface: the [iOS](/platforms/ios) and
[Android](/platforms/android) apps, the Apple Watch and Wear OS companions
bundled with them, the [macOS](/platforms/macos), [Windows](/platforms/windows),
and [Linux](/platforms/linux) desktop apps, the
[Chrome extension](/tools/chrome-extension), the in-app Plugins hub with
[ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai), and the Discord community and docs.

## Settings

Inside **Settings**, the dedicated sidebar includes **Ask OpenClaw** and starts with a **Search settings** field for quickly finding settings sections.

Form edits save automatically. If the connection changes while edits are pending,
autosave pauses until you choose **Save** to keep them or **Reload Config** to
discard them and load the current configuration. A successful reload resumes
autosave for new edits; an offline reload keeps the pending draft.
Devices node-binding controls also pause while configuration reloads, so a pending
read cannot overwrite a new selection.

In an agent's **Files** editor, **Add file** opens a missing optional workspace
document. Saving creates it only if it is still missing. If another editor or
process creates it first, the editor keeps your draft and reports a conflict.
**Reload** takes the current file; **Overwrite** reloads its current version and
then saves your draft against that version. Drafts keep their original file
version when you switch agents or refresh. If a remote workspace provider cannot
create files exclusively, saving explains how to update it or create the file on
that host and reload it; it does not overwrite a file silently.

**Native embed mode.** Native hosts can inject `window.__OPENCLAW_NATIVE_EMBED__ = { platform: "ios", formFactor: "phone" }` at document start to show settings without Dashboard navigation chrome. Supported platforms are `ios`, `macos`, and `android`; form factors are `phone`, `pad`, and `desktop`. In this mode, `/settings` lists the same visible groups and destinations as the settings sidebar. Every embedded route outside the settings root provides a Back button and title, including pages reached through links or tabs such as Memory import, Plugins, and Skill Workshop. Back follows app navigation history; direct links fall back to the nearest settings parent (Memory for Memory import) or `/settings`. Layouts respect device safe areas and use touch controls at phone widths. The flag changes presentation only: Gateway scopes and the existing native device-settings capability still determine which settings are available. Ordinary browser loads keep their existing navigation.

Choice fields that accept an explicit `null` value show it as a dropdown option. For optional fields, `null` remains distinct from clearing the setting or selecting its default. Rejected choices, such as a duplicate in a unique-value list, leave the previous selection in place.

For an empty integer field without a default, step buttons initialize positive-only or negative-only ranges at the permitted endpoint, matching keyboard arrows. For example, a field with a minimum of 1 starts at 1 on the first increment.

Incomplete array-row edits stay with their item when you remove earlier rows or edit other settings. Correct the field to save its new value.

On desktop web, the expanded sidebar header places the agent identity beside the sidebar collapse toggle (⌘B), command-palette search button (⌘K), and **New conversation** button. Clicking the identity opens the agent menu; **Home** opens the main session. When something needs action — failed or overdue cron jobs, expiring or expired model auth — compact attention chips appear above the sidebar footer and click through to the owning page. The identity shows the agent's avatar (identity image or emoji), name, optional environment pill, and unread dot; active-run status appears on the owning session row instead of beneath the agent name. Its agent-scoped menu contains the inline agent switcher (multi-agent setups), **New agent**, "What can this agent do?", and **Agent settings**. You can also create an agent from **Settings → Agents**: choose the standalone **New agent** button with zero or one agent, or the item at the bottom of the agent selector with multiple agents. Creation requires administrator access. The agent switcher lists pinned agents first and does not show a filter field; pin or unpin agents from the Agents settings page, with the pinned set stored in the browser profile. Choosing an agent scopes Chat plus Usage, Automations, Tasks, Workboard, and Sessions to that agent. Each scoped page exposes an **Agent** control with **All agents** as an escape; this widens the shared page scope without changing the concrete chat agent, while direct session links still open their target. The Agents settings page keeps its own [URL selection](/web/urls#route-table) and does not follow the shared page scope. The footer is one full-width identity card that remains available offline and shows **Reconnecting…** beneath the last-known account name. It opens the app/account menu, whose profile identity header is followed by **Settings**, **Usage**, mobile pairing, **Get the apps**, **Help** (help, Discord, Docs, and the changelog), an offline retry action when needed, the version/build chip, and the color-mode toggle. The build chip opens the About page. When the gateway runs from a source checkout on a branch other than `main`, the footer also shows that branch name in red so a non-release gateway is obvious at a glance (release installs never show it). Shift-Command-Comma on Apple platforms or Ctrl-Shift-Comma elsewhere opens **Settings** without overriding the browser's plain Command-Comma shortcut. Collapsing the sidebar (⌘B) hides it entirely for a full-width workspace; the top-left content cluster then provides expand, search, and new-session controls — mirroring what the macOS app hosts natively in its titlebar. The sidebar is the only navigation chrome on desktop, with no top bar. Narrow viewports swap the sidebar for a slide-over drawer behind a compact header row holding the drawer toggle, brand, and command-palette search; on phones, Chat absorbs that navigation row into its title bar, with the menu and search controls beside the session title. In the macOS app the separate header row folds the titlebar clearance into a single compact strip beside the window controls, while the sidebar header retains the agent identity and right-aligned **New conversation** button. Navigation uses regular browser history, so the browser's back/forward buttons traverse it; the macOS app adds a native sidebar toggle next to the window controls plus trackpad swipe gestures, with back/forward buttons at the sidebar's right edge while it is expanded and native search (command palette) and **New conversation** buttons while it is collapsed.

The bottom-left account footer, including the Settings sidebar, shows **Suspending…** while the Gateway prepares or drains work and **Suspended** once suspension is ready. Restart status takes precedence. During reconnect, fresh suspension reports from the Gateway keep that state visible; unexplained disconnects show **Offline**. The suspension indicator clears when the Gateway accepts work again or its last suspension report expires.

Sidebar visibility belongs to the current tab and is not remembered across tabs, windows, or reloads; the sidebar's width is still remembered. On desktop, new tabs, direct links, bookmarks, and reloads start with the sidebar expanded. Middle-click or Cmd/Ctrl-click a session to open it in a new tab without changing the original tab. Press ⌘B on Mac or Ctrl+B on Windows/Linux to collapse or expand the sidebar in the current tab.

Pending approvals also contribute an attention chip above the sidebar footer;
select it to open the owning Approvals page.

When an approval appears inline in a different session, **Approval requested by session**
uses the requesting session's loaded title, not the open conversation's title. If that
metadata is unavailable, the normal session-name fallback remains until it loads.
This label does not change which request the approval buttons resolve.

### Side panel keyboard shortcuts

The side panel **+** menu and the keyboard shortcut overview (⌘/ on Apple
platforms, Ctrl+/ elsewhere) show the same panel shortcuts. A shortcut opens its
panel, activates an existing hidden tab, or closes the panel when it is visible.
Only the active, presented chat pane responds, including while the composer has
focus. Availability follows the menu: Terminal, Browser, Desktop, and Discussion
need their corresponding capabilities; Dashboard needs an available session board
and is omitted in compact panes. Conversation has no shortcut.

| Panel      | macOS | Windows / Linux  |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Terminal   | ⌃\`   | Ctrl+\`          |
| Browser    | ⌘⌥⇧U  | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+U |
| Files      | ⌘⇧B   | Ctrl+Shift+B     |
| Side chat  | ⌘⇧S   | Ctrl+Shift+S     |
| Tasks      | ⌘⌥⇧K  | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K |
| Desktop    | ⌘⌥⇧D  | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D |
| Discussion | ⌘⌥⇧J  | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J |
| Dashboard  | ⌘⌥⇧G  | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+G |
| Review     | ⌘⌥⇧E  | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E |

Command+Option chords accept Option symbols through the physical key; Ctrl+Alt chords require the matching ASCII letter to preserve non-ASCII AltGr text. Dead keys and composition are ignored.

The new panel chords include Option/Alt to avoid browser actions such as developer
tools, Read Aloud, and find previous, and OpenClaw's existing debug-overlay shortcut.
The existing Terminal, Files, and Side chat bindings are unchanged.

<a id="this-mac-macos-app" />

### This device (macOS and iOS apps)

Inside the [macOS app](/platforms/macos), Settings includes a **This Mac** group
for settings on that Mac. **This Mac** (`/settings/device`) contains app behavior,
device capabilities, browser login import and cookie sync, and developer tools.
**Capabilities → Desktop sharing** is enabled by default and makes this Mac's
existing Screen Sharing service available in **Systems** after pairing approval.
It is separate from agent **Computer Control** and **Keep computer awake**.
Changing it reconnects this Mac automatically; it does not change the remote
Gateway host's desktop setting or enable macOS Screen Sharing.
**Permissions** (`/settings/device/permissions`) shows macOS permission status
and actions, location preferences, and active computer presence.

**Talk** adds a **This Mac** section for Voice Wake, push-to-talk, sounds,
microphone, and languages. **Updates** adds the app version, automatic update
preference, and **Check for Updates**. These device settings appear only inside
the OpenClaw app; ordinary browsers keep the Gateway settings. Talk trigger words
are Gateway settings and remain available in every browser.

On iOS, the group is **This iPhone** or **This iPad**. The device page shows
appearance, notifications, camera, keep awake, and health summaries when
available, plus actions to open Diagnostics, Licenses, About, and Apple Watch.
Only settings published by the app appear; iOS does not show Mac browser or
app-update controls. Permissions include the access published by the device,
including limited access to contacts or photos. Precise location is read-only
on iOS; **Open Settings** opens the system setting. Talk shows the device's
Voice Wake, Talk mode, Talk button, background Talk, and speakerphone controls.

## Custom plugin UI

Find **Labs** in the **System** section of the Settings sidebar, after **Infrastructure**.

**Settings → Labs → Custom plugin UI** enables native pages, widgets, actions,
and view replacements from user-installed plugins. It defaults to off and
writes `gateway.controlUi.experimental.customPlugins`. Changes apply without
restarting the Gateway, and connected pages refresh their plugin views
automatically. After disabling it, reload browser tabs to clear plugin
JavaScript that already ran.

Only enable it for plugin authors you trust: native UI runs in the Control UI
origin with the signed-in operator's Gateway authority. Native UI from enabled
bundled plugins, including Workboard, remains available with the lab off.
Backend plugin APIs, ordinary plugin loading, sandboxed dashboard widgets, and
MCP Apps are unaffected. All plugin APIs are experimental; see
[Feature plugins](/plugins/feature-plugins) for authoring and the trust model.

Authenticated native UI requires HTTPS or a browser-trusted loopback URL.
On non-local plain HTTP, plugin pages explain how to open a supported URL;
dashboard pairing and backend plugin operations remain available.

## Import assistant memory

Open **Settings** → **Import Memory** to bring local Codex, Claude Code, or Hermes memory
into an OpenClaw agent. The Gateway discovers supported local memory on its own
host, so a remote Control UI imports from the Gateway computer rather than the
browser computer.

If the agent list fails to load, the page shows the Gateway error. Select
**Refresh** to try again; **Settings → Memory** provides **Retry** for the same failure.

1. Choose the destination agent.
2. Review the detected source collections and Markdown filenames. File contents
   are not sent in the plan response or displayed in the page.
3. Select the collections to import and confirm. Apply rebuilds the plan before
   writing so stale selections fail safely.
4. If files already exist, enable **Replace existing imports**, refresh the
   preview, and confirm the replacement.

Codex imports only its consolidated `MEMORY.md` and `memory_summary.md`. Claude
Code imports Markdown from project auto-memory directories and a configured
`autoMemoryDirectory`; it does not import sessions, settings, instructions, or
credentials through this page. Files are copied below `memory/imports/` in the
selected workspace, where the active memory plugin can index them. Sources are
never changed.

For a narrower conversational path, open **Settings → Ask OpenClaw** and say
`import memory`. The chat wizard copies only new detected memory into the
existing default agent workspace; it does not choose another destination agent
or replace conflicts. It reports each source's confirmed copy count and warns
when a failure may have happened after a partial copy. Use the dedicated Import
Memory page when you need destination selection, a file preview, or replacement.

If an error says that apply completed but its result could not be returned,
inspect the migration report and destination files before starting another
import. Retrying the same pending request reuses its recorded outcome while
the Gateway retains it. A plugin cleanup warning does not undo completed copies.

Planning and applying require `operator.admin`. Every apply creates a verified
OpenClaw backup when state exists, writes a redacted migration report, and keeps
item-level backups before replacing existing destination files. See
[Memory overview](/concepts/memory#import-from-coding-assistants) for paths and
recall behavior.

## MCP page

The dedicated MCP page is an operator view for OpenClaw-managed MCP servers under `mcp.servers`. It does not start MCP transports by itself; use it to inspect and edit saved config, then use `openclaw mcp doctor --probe` when you need live server proof.

Typical workflow:

1. Open **MCP** from the sidebar.
2. Check the summary cards for total, enabled, OAuth, and filtered server counts.
3. Review each server row for transport, enablement, auth, filters, timeouts, and command hints.
4. Add, enable, disable, or remove servers directly on the MCP page. Choose Streamable HTTP, SSE, or stdio explicitly; stdio command lines accept quoted arguments such as paths with spaces. Use the **Plugins** page for one-click connectors and discovery.
5. Edit the scoped `mcp` config section for advanced server fields such as environment variables, working directories, headers, TLS/mTLS paths, OAuth metadata, tool filters, and Codex projection metadata.
6. Use **Save** for a config write, or **Save & Publish** when the running Gateway should apply the changed config.
7. Run `openclaw mcp status --verbose`, `openclaw mcp doctor --probe`, or `openclaw mcp reload` from a terminal for static diagnostics, live proof, or cached-runtime disposal.

The page redacts credential-bearing URL-like values before rendering and quotes server names in command snippets so copied commands still work with spaces or shell metacharacters. Full CLI and config reference: [MCP](/cli/mcp).

## Activity tab

Open **Activity** from the sidebar's page picker, or visit `/activity` under the Control UI's base path. It has two tabs plus a deep-link inspector:

- **Sessions** shows recent session activity grouped by day, with search, time, and people filters. Sessions sort newest first by their latest input or completed run, using the same time as the row's age and day group. Pins do not affect this order. Each row shows the human attribution and configured agent avatar/name. Subagent sessions are excluded from the feed, search results, and people counts. Active rows offer **Inspect run** when the Gateway has recorded a run reference.
- Each session can show a rolling recap in one to three sentences: what was done and where the work stands. Recaps use the agent's [utility model](/gateway/config-agents/models#agents-defaults-model) and are shared across clients and Gateway restarts. Initial loading uses shimmer placeholders; an existing recap shimmers while refreshing. A failed refresh keeps the last recap and identifies the refresh failure. **Retry recap** requests another attempt after the Gateway's cooldown. Read-only viewers can read cached recaps but cannot request generation. On a page with mixed permissions, view-only sessions do not block recap generation for writable sessions.
- Sessions with a GitHub checkout show associated branch PRs and their added/removed line counts. Hover or keyboard-focus a PR to preview its details, or select it to open GitHub. Before an open PR exists, the branch shows its diff against the default branch, including uncommitted work. These are checkout/PR statistics, not cumulative session edit counts; unavailable counts stay hidden, and retained stale data carries a warning.
- Sessions can show up to four transcript images in one compact horizontal row. On narrow screens, scroll the previews sideways to see the remaining images. Select an image to expand it in the image viewer. Previews load as rows approach the viewport, reading bounded recent transcript pages; **Search older images** continues when more history remains. Existing thumbnails remain visible during refreshes and failed retries. Changing the session or connection clears the previous gallery.
- **Live activity** shows running and queued sessions above the ephemeral browser-local tool stream. The session snapshot comes from the Gateway; the tool stream uses the same `session.tool` and tool events that power Chat tool cards.
- **Run inspector** is deep-link only and reads the Gateway's durable, immutable `audit.run.inspect` safe-only projection. The RPC contains required `decisionDisplays` and never a raw `decisions` field. Use **Inspect run** on an active session or the run ID link in Live activity, or open `/activity?view=run&run=<percent-encoded-run-id>` directly. Reloading or revisiting the link queries the Gateway again; it never reconstructs identity from Live activity.

The Sessions view owns its query independently of the sidebar. Its people filter uses the Gateway's full visible-session associations before pagination, not the four-avatar participant preview. `sessions.list` accepts `involvingProfileId` and `includePeople`; the response reports the canonical selected profile ID, bounded people counts, and `peopleIncomplete`. Only Gateway profiles appear as people. Remote, agent, and unresolved identities cannot acquire profile names or links through an equal raw ID. Counts and dates describe associated sessions, not a person's last input; recorded participation, verified creation, and assigned responsibility remain distinct from permission to see a session. Old profile links follow profile merges. A limit notice identifies incomplete participant history or truncated results.

The Sessions view collects session-change events in a randomized four-to-five-second window that later events cannot postpone. After an automatic refresh completes, the next waits three times its duration, bounded between five and 15 seconds. Event-driven refreshes pause while the browser tab is hidden and catch up once when you return, respecting that cooldown. Changing filters or retrying a failed request still loads immediately. The sidebar's session capability also [reuses row snapshots and paces list reads](/web/control-ui/sessions-and-sidebar#sidebar-navigation). Activity links retain their search and people filters during initial loading and navigation.

The Gateway updates recaps when new work happens, throttling ongoing updates and catching up after a run ends. A shared queue runs at most two recap calls at once and retries temporary overload or rate-limit failures up to three times with increasing delays, honoring provider retry timing. Authentication, configuration, and exhausted subscription failures require correction before retrying. Idle sessions make no repeated model calls. Archiving retains the recap and requests catch-up; an agent still running in an archived session can update it when work finishes. Reopening or new work resumes freshness checks. Older sessions backfill in bounded chronological chunks when requested from Activity. Recaps read user and assistant conversation text, preferring final answers and skipping tool calls/results. Existing cached recaps gradually adopt the shorter format through the same queue while retaining their previous coverage. Incognito sessions and subagent sessions do not generate recaps. Recaps are generated text and do not determine whether a task is complete or grant access to a session.

To find an older archived conversation, choose **Sessions**, **All time**, and **Everyone** in the people filter, then enter its name or label in **Search session titles…**. This metadata search includes archived sessions and applies across the complete caller-visible store before the 100-result window. Narrow the query if results are truncated. Open an archived match to read its retained history, then select **Unarchive** to continue the same conversation.

**Active sessions** loads when you open Live activity and refreshes after reconnecting, so sessions already running or queued appear before new tool events arrive. It shows up to 100 sessions you are allowed to see, including work on other agents and agent-owned global sessions. A limit notice appears when more sessions match. Select a linked row to open that session. Reserved `unknown` sessions show status without a conversation link; raw `global` sessions do the same outside global session scope, where the Home URL addresses a different session. Changes update this snapshot while the view is open; disconnected or failed reads show a visible status instead of claiming that sessions are idle. **Clear** only clears the received-event list. It does not clear or stop active sessions.

Live activity keeps up to 100 sanitized summaries with redacted, truncated output previews. Tool argument values are not stored in Activity state; the UI shows that arguments are hidden and records only the argument field count.

Live activity collects events only while this view is open and the browser tab is visible. It watches the bounded, authorized **Active sessions** roster and releases those subscriptions when you hide the tab or leave the view. Activity from before you opened the view is not shown. Use the search, tool, and status filters to narrow received entries. Leaving the Activity page, reloading, changing Gateway or authentication context, and **Clear** reset the list. Ordinary reconnects preserve received entries and expansion state, then resume subscriptions from the refreshed roster. This browser-local feed is not a durable record of work performed while the view was closed, hidden, or disconnected.

The Run inspector shows the retained trust domain, ingress, invoker, represented subject, sponsor, agent definition and principal, runtime instance, applicable grants, assurance evidence, lineage, and a bounded decision-receipt list. Every fact has a text evidence state. **Absent** means the owning boundary explicitly recorded no value; **unattributed** means a supported path had no usable invoker; **unknown** means expected evidence is missing or unreadable; and **unsupported** means the path has no Phase 0 evidence contract. Color is supplemental only.

Select a receipt to see the Gateway's bounded safe-display projection: structural action and outcome fields, evidence limits, and verified display provenance. Fixed core summaries and next steps appear only when the Gateway knows the producer contract from the owning call path. Generic or otherwise unverified receipts show a structural `unknown` classification and omit their summary, remediation, and self-asserted owner metadata. Activity consumes the safe result directly: it performs no UI-side inference, post-receive stripping, or raw-receipt fallback. **Enforced** means the recorded owner changed the outcome after validating the exact context, execution, and run tuple. **Attribution only** records what happened without claiming authorization. **Unsupported** means that observation has no Phase 0 enforcement contract. The inspector displays these states as text badges as well as color and never infers a reason from another field.

Receipt requests are limited to 50 records. **Load more receipts** follows the Gateway's opaque cursor and keeps earlier pages visible. A later-page error does not discard receipts already shown. Each receipt link adds `receipt=<opaque-display-selector>` and, for a later page, `decision=<opaque-cursor>` to the selected run or execution URL. The Gateway-owned selector chooses the projected display row without exposing the stored receipt identifier in the URL or as page text. Reloading that link requests the same bounded page and selects the same projected row. An expired or invalid page cursor is an explicit inspection error; choose **Restart inspection** to keep the selected run or execution and restart from the first page.

Approval and message-delivery links use the `approval-decision:` and `message-decision:` selector namespaces. The owner query mints each selector from its row metadata in the same snapshot as the displayed receipt; private receipt, resolution, and event identifiers never become URL parameters.

Run inspection requires `operator.read` and a Gateway that advertises `audit.run.inspect`. Execution identity collection is off by default; enable `logging.audit.executionIdentity`, restart the Gateway, and record a new run when you need this evidence. Retained contexts are limited to 30 days and 100,000 rows. A known run can therefore report unavailable or expired identity evidence, and a run reference can be ambiguous when it correlates more than one execution. The UI does not guess between executions: choose a returned candidate to navigate to `/activity?view=run&execution=<percent-encoded-execution-id>` and query that exact execution.

The audit ledger is best-effort operational evidence, not a lossless compliance archive. A missing or expired record does not prove that a run or action did not occur. The inspector never displays prompt or message text, command bodies, arguments, file paths, credentials, environment values, raw source identifiers, or arbitrary plugin data. See [Audit history](/gateway/audit) for collection, privacy, retention, and CLI inspection details.

## Meetings page

Open the sidebar's pencil menu (**Edit pinned items**) and choose **Meetings**
to read saved meeting notes at `/meetings`. Choose **Edit pinned items** inside
that menu to pin Meetings; it is not a default pinned item.
Meeting transcripts are separate from agent chat-history search in **Sessions**.

Each page contains up to 50 meetings, grouped by local day with newest first.
Rows show participant previews, duration, an overview when available, and distinct
**In progress** and **No speech captured** states. Search by title or session/source ID, then
select a meeting. Existing `/meetings?selector=...` links open **Summary** by default,
including while capture is active. Meeting URLs are not searched. Open **Filters** for
provider, account, agent, and date controls; the disclosure opens automatically
when those filters are active. Provider, account, and agent IDs match
exactly. Date filters use UTC session start times, with an inclusive lower bound
and exclusive upper bound. **Next page** continues the ordered results;
**First page**, a filter change, or **Refresh** starts a new pagination pass.
The reader opens **Summary** for both active and completed meetings. Select
**Transcript** to read timestamped speech. An explicitly selected tab stays selected,
including when capture ends. A URL with a transcript search and no explicit tab
opens **Transcript**. Timestamped speaker text appears alongside the list on desktop
or in a single column on mobile. Its URL preserves the selected meeting and tab.

While the page is visible and connected, the library and active meeting refresh
automatically every three seconds. **Live capture** shows elapsed time; an empty
active transcript says **Waiting for speech**. Updates show saved speech, so
provider capture and transcription can add latency. Background reads preserve
filter drafts, the current transcript page, and loaded history without a loading
flash. The reader automatically loads every page and retains earlier text. Hidden tabs pause
automatic reads and catch up when visible again. Completed meetings refresh less
frequently once notes are available; a meeting without notes keeps checking for
the stored summary after capture stops.

Active captures generate a summary about every five minutes when new speech has
been saved, using the owning agent's utility model. Summary jobs do not overlap;
quiet periods keep the existing notes. The configured primary model and then
text heuristics provide fallback notes when needed. **Summary so far** marks
interim notes and shows when they were generated. Capture continues during
summary generation, and stopping the meeting saves a fresh final summary.

**Search within this transcript** searches the full stored transcript in bounded
server pages that load automatically until the complete transcript or all matches
are visible. **Summary** renders the stored Markdown
notes with the transcript section kept in the separate **Transcript** tab, and labels model-generated or
heuristic provenance when available. Opening a meeting with speech but no saved
summary automatically requests generation for operators with write access. A
generating state remains visible until notes arrive; failures offer a retry.
Missing summaries and empty transcripts have distinct empty states.
Saved summaries load independently of speech pages. If a transcript page exceeds
its transfer limit, you can still read the saved notes and download an export
within the export limit below.

**Download Markdown** downloads the transcript and any stored summary;
**Download JSONL** downloads the reader's public utterance projection, including
full text, sequence, utterance and speaker identity, source timestamps, and
finality when available. Provider-private metadata and local filesystem paths
are excluded; local CLI exports retain their existing raw format. Browser exports are limited to
4 MiB and fail visibly rather than downloading a partial file. For larger exports,
use the [Transcripts CLI](/cli/transcripts). Archive access requires `operator.read`
or its write/admin implication and a profile allowed to read the shared archive;
an agent filter does not bypass that restriction.

If a library read or download reports denied access, the browser clears its
cached library and reader pages. **Retry** keeps those notes hidden until a fresh
authorized response arrives and starts the reader from its first page. Temporary
network errors alone do not remove already loaded reader pages. Files already
downloaded remain yours.

Configure capture in **Settings → Communications → Meeting capture**, which also
links back to the library. Administrators can change the existing
`transcripts.enabled` setting and add, edit, or remove `transcripts.autoStart`
sources. Edits preserve account and source locators, titles, and custom session
IDs through the shared config draft. Form changes auto-save through the standard
Settings coordinator, including validation and conflict handling. If a restart
interrupts a pending draft, the footer shows **Autosave paused after reconnect**;
review the retained draft and select **Save** to submit it on the new connection.
**Messages** remains the default Communications section. The full transcript schema editor
is available under **Meeting capture → Advanced settings**.

Title-only edits keep the current capture running and apply the new title to
future captures; current and saved notes are not renamed. Continuous capture
supports an optional custom session ID. Leave it empty for generated IDs and
avoid reusing IDs from the same day, which can collide with existing archive
entries. Occupancy mode chooses session IDs automatically and ignores the custom
ID field. The editor disables that field in occupancy mode while preserving its
saved value. Health distinguishes startup retries from capture attempts that
cannot safely retry. See [capture configuration](/cli/transcripts#configuration).

Enabled plugin manifests with explicit auto-start setup metadata are offered for
new sources even before runtime loads. An observed runtime `canStart: false`
prevents new setup. The manifest declares which
locator fields are supported and required. Existing entries remain editable
without losing fields when metadata is unavailable. Providers that only attach
to an already-active meeting bot are not offered as boot auto-start sources.

Capture is opt-in for voice channels: joining voice does not record, and recording
participants does not grant command or agent permissions. **Enabled** permits
capture; **Armed** reports a registered subscription, not confirmed recording.
**Not active** and **Unknown** remain distinct. Configured URL sources remain
unknown when the retained sanitized URL cannot prove the original invitation
identity. Saved utterance counts come from
durable rows. The latest saved transcript is the most recently updated session
containing utterances, not an exact last-ingestion ordering. Source speech times
are labeled explicitly; ingestion timestamps are not recorded. Continuous sources may span several room occupations. With occupancy mode
enabled, capture saves notes when the room empties and may continue a recently
stopped capture from the same source and agent within ten minutes when its stored
ID origin is known to be generated. A supplied or unknown origin starts a fresh
capture, leaving the existing notes unchanged.
Speech-to-text may use your configured provider and incur provider usage. The UI
does not play raw audio, generate summaries on demand, or delete transcripts.

Meetings reads the same shared SQLite records as `openclaw transcripts`.
Discord voice and the Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom meeting plugins
populate this store. See the [Transcripts CLI](/cli/transcripts) for capture setup,
agent reads, and exports.
