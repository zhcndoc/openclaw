summary: "Browser-based control UI for the Gateway (chat, activity, nodes, config)"
read_when:
  - You want to operate the Gateway from a browser
  - You want Tailnet access without SSH tunnels
title: "Control UI"
sidebarTitle: "Control UI"
---

The Control UI is a small **Vite + Lit** single-page app served by the Gateway:

- default: `http://<host>:18789/`
- optional prefix: set `gateway.controlUi.basePath` (e.g. `/openclaw`)

`gateway.controlUi.enabled` hot-applies. Disable it to stop serving dashboard
pages and assets while bots and existing Gateway connections keep running.
Re-enable it to resume serving; missing assets are prepared in the background.
Changing the serving base path or asset root still requires a Gateway restart.

For unmatched HTTP paths, the app-shell fallback respects the request's `Accept` header. An explicit HTML rejection such as `text/html;q=0, */*` overrides the broader wildcard, so the request reaches the startup `503` or final `404` response. Headerless and wildcard-only requests retain the browser navigation fallback.

It speaks **directly to the Gateway WebSocket** on the same port.

While the initial connection or a route loads, shimmer placeholders reserve the chat layout. They respect your theme and reduced-motion preference; Gateway startup progress remains visible when available.

Closed Terminal, Browser, Desktop, and Home/Ask OpenClaw panels initialize when you open them rather than during initial navigation. Panels saved as open still restore after a reload.

Choose **New agent** in the sidebar or Agents home to open the custodian chat.
It recommends a chief of staff, researcher, writer, reviewer, or a small team
with all four. Reply with a choice, or describe custom work and a name. Role
choices use the same [role templates](/cli/agents#role-templates) as the CLI;
creation waits for operator approval. Created agents appear in Agents home and
the agent switcher.
If team creation stops partway through, the custodian reports the retained
agents so you can inspect them before creating the missing members.

## Watch a desktop in Picture-in-Picture

Connect the Desktop viewer, then choose **Open desktop in Picture-in-Picture** in
its toolbar. The browser opens a view-only, always-on-top window so you can watch
the remote computer while using other tabs or apps. The same action is available
in the docked panel, chat side panel, and focused desktop window.

This requires a secure context (HTTPS or localhost) and a desktop browser that
exposes the Document Picture-in-Picture API, including supported Chrome and
Firefox versions. The control is disabled when the API is unavailable or the
desktop is not connected. Browser permissions can still deny the request; check
those permissions and click the control again to retry. OpenClaw does not replace
unsupported PiP with an ordinary popup.

PiP mirrors the existing live connection without taking control or opening a
second desktop connection. Closing PiP leaves the original viewer and remote task
running. Disconnecting, changing the viewer's source or session, or closing the
originating viewer closes PiP; it does not stop the remote task. Keep the opener
tab open. A sleeping computer or a browser that suspends the entire page cannot
continue streaming.

## Quick open (local)

If the Gateway is running on the same computer, open [http://127.0.0.1:18789/](http://127.0.0.1:18789/) (or [http://localhost:18789/](http://localhost:18789/)).

If the page fails to load, start the Gateway first: `openclaw gateway`.

<Note>
On native Windows LAN binds, Windows Firewall or organization-managed Group Policy can still block the advertised LAN URL even when `127.0.0.1` works on the Gateway host. Run `openclaw gateway status --deep` on the Windows host; it reports likely-blocked ports, profile mismatches, and local firewall rules that policy may ignore.
</Note>

Auth is supplied during the WebSocket handshake via:

- the configured shared secret in either `connect.params.auth.token` or
  `connect.params.auth.password`; `gateway.auth.mode` selects the configured
  value (`gateway.auth.token` or `gateway.auth.password`)
- Tailscale Serve identity headers when `gateway.auth.allowTailscale: true`
- trusted-proxy identity headers when `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"`

Gateway auth runs before device pairing. A direct loopback connection does not bypass token or password auth. The login screen and **Settings → Gateway** use one **Gateway secret** field: paste the token or type the password. After a successful connection, the UI keeps the secret in session storage for the current browser tab and Gateway origin only when the Gateway reports token auth. Passwords stay in memory and are never persisted. After pairing, the browser can use its stored per-device token on later connections.

If you paste a setup code from **Devices → Pair device → Copy setup code** into **Gateway secret**, the UI shows an inline hint before you connect. Paste that code into **Settings → Gateway** in the OpenClaw mobile app. For the Control UI, run `openclaw gateway auth-token --show` in an interactive terminal on the Gateway host and paste the shared token instead. If a connection with a setup code is rejected for a token or password mismatch, the login screen repeats this guidance.

Local onboarding generates a Gateway secret in token mode by default, without a token/password picker, and preserves existing password mode. Use `--gateway-auth password` or `--gateway-password <value>` for explicit password setup; Tailscale Funnel requires password mode. If the Gateway starts in token mode without a configured token, it generates an ephemeral runtime token for that process instead. The runtime token is not written to config, so it cannot be recovered and a loopback browser without that token is rejected. Run `openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token`, restart the Gateway, then run `openclaw gateway auth-token --show` in an interactive terminal and paste the output into **Gateway secret**.

## Agents home

Open **Agents** in the sidebar, choose **All agents** in the agent switcher, or
visit `/agents` to see your configured agents as a roster. Each card shows the
agent's identity, model, current work status, last activity, and a preview from its
main chat. **Open chat** opens that agent's
main session. Working agents appear first, followed by the most recently active.

**Manage agents** opens `/settings/agents`. **New agent** opens the existing
agent creation flow when available, or agent settings otherwise. `/agents` now
opens the roster; agent configuration remains at `/settings/agents`.

To browse sessions across agents, choose **Show all agents** in the
agent switcher. This enables **team mode**, a browser preference that is off by
default. The top row becomes a workspace header with the configured Gateway display
name, or **OpenClaw**, and the OpenClaw mark. Its menu contains **Show one agent**,
**Agent settings**, and the existing documentation, help, community, and changelog
links. Sessions appear under collapsible agent headers in configured roster order,
which stays stable as activity changes. **Home** disappears from Pages: click an agent header's avatar or name to
open that agent's main chat. The separate collapse control only folds its sessions.
The top **+**, labeled **New conversation**, opens an agent menu with avatars and names in
the same order as the groups; choosing an agent opens New session for that agent.
Each group's **+** does this directly, appearing on hover or keyboard focus and remaining visible on touch devices. Selecting a session switches the active
agent for chat. Choose **Show one agent** in the workspace menu to restore the
agent chip, Home row, and direct New session button.

Enabling team mode also defaults the shared page scope to **All agents**, while
remembering the previous scope to restore when you turn it off. That scope,
including an explicit **All agents** selection, is saved in this browser for each
gateway. It survives reloads and switching to another gateway and back, even if
you open a different agent's chat in team mode. Turning team mode off clears the
remembered value after restoring it. You can still
choose a narrower scope; navigating between pages does not reset that choice.
Automations, Dashboards, Sessions, Tasks, and Usage support all-agent views, with
agent identity shown on mixed-agent rows. Memory, Model providers, and Skill
Workshop stay scoped to one agent. Open an agent's main chat from its group header
to select that agent before visiting those pages; chat actions always belong to
the conversation's agent.

Choose **All sessions** from an agent group’s options menu to open the Sessions
page filtered to that agent. Open **Agents** in the sidebar to return to the roster
page. See [Sidebar navigation](/web/control-ui/sessions-and-sidebar#sidebar-navigation)
for group controls and filtering.

Agent names and avatars follow agent and identity updates. While a configured avatar image loads,
the avatar keeps its tinted background with no face or text. The image appears when ready;
an emoji or generated face appears only when no image is configured or the image fails to load.
This behavior is shared by the roster, agent switcher, identity chips, settings, and chat.

Activity and previews on the page and sidebar roster refresh on session events
and Gateway reconnects. When both are visible, they share one activity window and
one refresh, so opening **Agents** while team mode is visible does not duplicate requests. Activity loading
stops when neither roster is visible. Each refresh reads at most 300 sessions
across agents, loading pinned sessions first and then the most recent sessions.
Pinned sessions count toward that limit; sessions outside the window do not appear
in the grouped sidebar or contribute to activity summaries, except that the open
conversation remains visible so direct links keep a selected row. When a main session
is absent from the window, its agent's most recent session supplies the preview.
