title: "Control UI URLs"

The Control UI uses readable paths for pages and session links. A configured
`gateway.controlUi.basePath` prefixes every path below. For example, `/chat/main`
becomes `/openclaw/chat/main` when the base path is `/openclaw`.

## Session and dashboard URLs

**Copy → Session link** uses the connected Gateway's public Control UI address
when `gateway.publicOrigin` is configured, including its
`gateway.controlUi.basePath`. This keeps links shareable when the desktop app
connects through a local SSH tunnel. Without a public origin, copied links use
the connected Gateway's HTTP(S) address; a tunnel-only address remains local.
Normal navigation and **Open in** continue using the current UI. Copied links
contain no connection credentials. Recipients need Gateway access unless the
thread has [public access](/web/urls#public-session-transcripts) enabled.

If the Gateway disconnects while a session link is loading, the Control UI retries
the interrupted load after reconnecting. Navigating elsewhere cancels that recovery;
it does not reopen an old destination or add a browser-history entry. Already loaded
conversations stay mounted across reconnects.

The Dashboards gallery adds `?dashboard=expanded` to the owning task's chat
link, for example `/chat/main/deploy-monitor-6db92d48?dashboard=expanded`.
This makes Dashboard the main view and focuses it. **Restore split** brings
the side panel alongside the dashboard. Ordinary task navigation restores the browser's
saved task arrangement instead of forcing a dashboard-only view.

Chat and dashboard views are parallel route namespaces:

```text
/chat/main/deploy-monitor-6db92d48
/dashboard/main/deploy-monitor-6db92d48
/chat/main/telegram/12345
/chat/main/cron/nightly/run/8821
/chat/main
```

The path grammar is:

```text
/<namespace>/<agentId>
/<namespace>/<agentId>/<sessionRef>
/<namespace>/<agentId>/<restSegment>/<restSegment>...
```

`<namespace>` is either `/chat` or `/dashboard`. The first form opens that
agent's main session. The other forms encode one immutable session key in one of
two ways.

The short-id form applies to non-Incognito sessions when the key's rest, everything after
`agent:<agentId>:`, ends in a UUID. `<sessionRef>` is an optional display-name
slug plus a short id, such as `deploy-monitor-6db92d48`. The short id is the
authoritative part: at least eight lowercase hexadecimal characters from the
start of the key's trailing UUID, with UUID dashes omitted. Longer prefixes up
to all 32 hexadecimal characters are accepted. The row's rotating `sessionId`
is not part of the URL identity.

The Control UI generates links with all 32 UUID characters by default, so a
selected session keeps its identity even when another session shares its prefix
and display name. Existing shorter links still resolve, and the disambiguation
view can offer the shortest unique prefix. Resolving a literal or display-name
link to a UUID session also keeps the full UUID in its canonical URL.

Every other key uses the literal-key form. Each colon-delimited segment after
`agent:<agentId>:` becomes one URL-encoded path segment. For example,
`agent:main:telegram:12345` becomes `/chat/main/telegram/12345`, and
`agent:main:cron:nightly:run:8821` becomes
`/chat/main/cron/nightly/run/8821`.

Incognito sessions always use the literal-key form, even when their keys end
in a UUID. For example, an Incognito link looks like
`/chat/main/dashboard/incognito-12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef`.
Incognito sessions are excluded from short-id and display-name discovery;
their exact links still require administrator access and work only while the
session exists. Reopen an existing session from the sidebar to replace an old
short-id link that reports **Session not found**.

Literal rest segments exactly equal to `.` or `..` use `~dot` and `~dotdot` so
browsers cannot collapse them as relative path segments. A literal segment that
starts with `~` doubles that leading character to keep the encoding reversible.
When an otherwise literal one-segment rest could be mistaken for a short id,
the builder inserts `~key` before it, for example
`agent:main:release-deadbeef` becomes
`/chat/main/~key/release-deadbeef`. The marker forces literal interpretation
when a reference could otherwise be ambiguous. Builders also use it for the
ordinary key `agent:research:global`, producing `/chat/research/~key/global`
to distinguish it from the raw `global` home-session key, which uses
`/chat/research`. Existing `/chat/research/global` literal links still resolve
to `agent:research:global`.

The reserved single-segment literal rest names are `main`, `global`, `boot`,
and `sessions`. Exactly one segment after the agent id is literal when it is
reserved or does not contain a valid short id; otherwise it is a short reference.
Two or more segments after the agent id are always literal.

The canonical main session `agent:research:main` uses the agent-only path
`/chat/research`. Custom `session.mainKey` values are ignored by config loading;
setting it to `"workspace"` does not make `/chat/research/workspace` a main-session
route. It follows ordinary session lookup; if no existing session matches, it shows
**Session not found**.

### Stability contract

The following parts are stable URL contracts:

- The `/chat` and `/dashboard` namespace words.
- The key UUID short id in short-id URLs.
- The arity and short-versus-literal parsing rules above.

In short-id form, the agent segment is decorative and the slug is almost
decorative. Neither identifies the session on its own, and both may change
without notice. The one exception is a tie: if the short id matches more than
one session and exactly one of them still carries the slug in the link, that
session is used, so a generated link keeps working even when two ids happen to
share a prefix. A slug that matches none or several of the tied sessions is
ignored and the disambiguation view is shown. After resolution, the Control UI
replaces the address bar with the current agent id and current display-name slug
without adding a browser-history entry.

In literal-key form, the agent segment is authoritative because it is part of
the reconstructed session key. The remaining literal segments are authoritative
too. A slug, when present, is always decorative; literal-key forms do not
synthesize one.

As a best-effort convenience, an unescaped one-segment literal that does not
resolve as an exact session key is also checked against display-name slugs. One
exact slug match is replaced in the address bar with its full
`/<namespace>/<agentId>/<slug>-<shortId>` reference. If several sessions share
the slug, the UI shows the same disambiguation view used for short-id ties
instead of guessing. Exact short-id and literal-key references always win over
slug matching.

If one short id matches more than one session and the slug does not settle it,
the UI does not guess. It shows a small disambiguation view with the matching
display names, agents, and longer id prefixes. Use a longer prefix to make the
URL unique. Current Gateways return at most ten recent candidates; when that
bound is reached, the view treats the result as incomplete instead of guessing.

Opening the Control UI at `/` or `/chat` restores the browser's last selected
session. If that session no longer exists, the UI opens its agent's main session;
if the agent was removed, it uses the current agent instead. Explicit links to
missing sessions keep showing the "Session not found" recovery page.

To continue one of these links in the terminal or attach a coding harness, see
[Session synchronization and attachment](/concepts/session-attachment).

Canonical links do not use `?session=` or `?face=`. Released links such as
`/chat?session=<sessionKey>` are accepted only at the application boundary as a
migration aid and immediately rewritten, without adding browser history, to the
canonical path. The released `?face=dashboard` companion selects the
`/dashboard` namespace during that rewrite. Loaders and page code never read the
query-form identity, and new links must not emit it. The Sessions list keeps its
own `?session=` parameter because that parameter expands a row; it is not a
session deep link. The one-shot composer value `?draft=` remains supported on
chat and dashboard session paths.

### Native catalog links

Native catalog threads use the agent path with a source query:

```text
/chat/<agentId>?catalog=<catalogId>&host=<hostId>&thread=<threadId>
```

URL-encode each query value. The agent in the path owns the OpenClaw pane,
including catalog reads and continuation; `catalog`, `host`, and `thread`
identify the native source. Opening the same source under different agents
keeps their panes and drafts separate, including in split view. Continuing a
thread navigates to the adopted OpenClaw session link. The same catalog query
also works under `/dashboard/<agentId>`.

## Social previews

Use **Copy → Preview link** in a session's menu to share a link with an OpenClaw
social card. It opens a small public landing page; **Open dashboard** or
**Open session** then takes the recipient to the normal authenticated view.
**Copy → Session link** still copies the direct link.

For example, `/share/dashboard/main/deploy-monitor-6db92d48` previews
`/dashboard/main/deploy-monitor-6db92d48`. A configured Control UI base path
prefixes both paths. The preview serves Open Graph metadata and a 1200 × 630 PNG
at `/share/card.png`, without requiring JavaScript or a Gateway connection.

The card shows generic OpenClaw branding, not the session's title, messages,
dashboard widgets, or screenshots. Preview requests never look up session state,
so the page does not reveal whether the target exists. The link itself still
contains the session route and, for catalog sessions, the catalog routing fields.
Treat those URLs as information you are choosing to share.

### Behind a login proxy

Link crawlers cannot sign in to your proxy. Allow anonymous `GET` and `HEAD`
requests **only** to the Control UI's `/share/*` namespace (for example,
`/openclaw/share/*` for a `/openclaw` base path). Keep the dashboard, WebSocket,
bootstrap, API, and other routes protected. Do not grant crawlers authenticated
access based on their User-Agent.

For Cloudflare Access, use a separate application matching that public path with
a Bypass policy; keep the existing authenticated application for the rest of the
host. See [Cloudflare's application path rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/app-paths/).
This is an operator deployment step; OpenClaw does not change proxy policies.

Set the existing `gateway.publicOrigin` to your external HTTP(S) origin when TLS
terminates at the proxy, so the image and canonical URLs use the public HTTPS
address. Without it, previews use the request's Host and direct connection
protocol; forwarded headers are not trusted for public preview URLs.

Verify both the preview URL and its `/share/card.png` return `200` without
cookies, then check that opening the dashboard still requires login. If a chat
app shows the login page or no image, check for proxy redirects on both preview
requests. Ordinary dashboard URLs remain protected and do not gain crawler
access from this feature.

## Public session transcripts

A thread has one normal `/chat/<agentId>/<sessionRef>` URL for signed-in people
and anonymous readers. Session creators and Gateway admins can open **Session
sharing → Public access → Enable public access** to publish its existing and
future conversation text. **Copy public link** copies the normal thread URL,
not a separate viewer address. The chat header shows **Public** while access is enabled.

A signed-out visitor sees the public conversation with a **Log in** button.
Signing in returns to the same thread and applies the person's existing
permissions; it does not grant editing or access to other sessions. A signed-in
person without private access can still read the public version. Private,
missing, and ambiguous anonymous targets show the same unavailable page without
revealing names or candidate sessions.

Assigning another owner does not transfer public-sharing authority. If the
controls are unavailable, confirm that the session is saved, is not incognito,
and you are its creator or a Gateway admin. See
[Multi-user mode](/concepts/multi-user#world-readable-session-links).

Public access is separate from teammate visibility and editing permissions.
The public reader does not open a Gateway WebSocket, subscribe to the session
roster, send messages, invoke tools, or open private dashboards. It shows user
messages and assistant final answers with Markdown formatting. Tool output,
reasoning, files, images, executable widgets, internal metadata, and hidden
messages are omitted. Credential-pattern redaction is best effort, not a
guarantee that sensitive prose is detected. Review the conversation before
publishing and remember that future messages become public too.

The latest public view checks for updates approximately every 15 seconds while
visible. **Older messages** opens earlier pages without automatic refresh;
**Back to latest** returns to the live view. Pages and long messages are bounded,
with visible omission notices. The initial conversation and social metadata
work without JavaScript.

### Revocation and older links

**Disable public access** stops anonymous reads through the normal thread URL.
Re-enabling publication makes that same URL readable again. Resetting, replacing,
forking, or deleting a session does not transfer its publication to a new
instance. Disabling access cannot recall copies already downloaded by readers.

Previously issued `/share/session` token links remain bound to their original
publication and exact session instance. Disabling and re-enabling public access
does not revive those older token links. Their encrypted tokens remain bound to
the installation identity, independently of the Gateway login password or token.
A full backup preserves that identity and the session databases; moving only an
agent database to another installation invalidates its old token links. The
normal thread URL is not a secret capability: current public-sharing state
determines whether anonymous access is allowed.

### Login-proxy deployment

Deploy the public thread handler before changing the proxy. Permit anonymous
thread-document requests under the Control UI's `/chat/*` namespace and the
existing `/share/*` namespace, including the configured base path. The Gateway
rejects mutation methods on public thread documents. Keep the root application,
WebSocket, bootstrap, APIs, media, dashboards, settings, and the protected
`/__openclaw__/session-entry` login handoff behind authentication. Do not bypass
authentication for the whole host or for the `__openclaw__` namespace.

The public thread route does not trust identity headers on the bypassed path.
Its small browser helper checks the protected session-entry route and enters
the authenticated app only through the existing authentication and session
permission owners. The login return target must be a same-origin chat path;
external URLs and arbitrary application/API paths are rejected.

Set `gateway.publicOrigin` to the external HTTPS origin and make the trusted
proxy overwrite `X-Forwarded-Proto` with the external scheme. Verify public
threads and the share card without cookies, private-thread non-disclosure,
login returning to the same thread, and authentication on all protected routes.
OpenClaw does not change Cloudflare Access or other proxy policies automatically.

### Reader capacity

Public pages share bounded rendered representations and in-flight work.
Committed session and transcript changes invalidate affected pages; every
response, including `304 Not Modified`, still checks live publication authority.
Representations are retained only on the server, not in a shared browser/CDN
cache. Eight distinct builds may run at once, two for one publication, with
32 additional builds queued. Overload returns `503` and `Retry-After`.

Request budgets are 120 per minute for one attributed client and 240 per minute
for one publication, including cached responses. These accommodate 20 readers
behind one IP at the default refresh interval without removing abuse limits.
They are admission budgets, not a guarantee of throughput on every host.

## Person activity URLs

Open a person's recent sessions with a readable Activity link:

```text
/activity/ada-12345678abcd
/activity/ada-12345678abcd?time=30d&q=release
```

New links use the person's display-name slug and the first 12 lowercase
hexadecimal characters of their profile UUID, with UUID dashes omitted. The
name is decorative: renamed people and stale names still resolve by the id
prefix. A missing name produces a bare-prefix link.

Prefixes from 8 through 32 hexadecimal characters are accepted. If a prefix
matches several profiles, Activity shows an error instead of choosing a person.
Recorded profile identities in retained sessions still resolve if their profile
row is missing; they also participate in ambiguity checks before session filters.
For restricted readers, lookup uses only caller-visible session associations;
hidden draft and incognito sessions cannot affect resolution or ambiguity.
Search, time windows, and pagination do not narrow that visibility scope.
Use a longer prefix, the full 32-character compact UUID, or the full dashed
UUID to select the exact profile. Names never break a tie.

Existing `/activity?person=<profile-id>` links remain accepted and are replaced
with the person path after resolution, without adding browser history. Search
and time filters remain query parameters. Exact UUID bookmarks retain all 32
hexadecimal characters, and unresolved IDs never redirect to a shorter prefix.
Clearing the person filter returns
to `/activity` while retaining those filters. Normal Gateway authentication
and session visibility rules apply to every form.

## Terminal URLs

The main terminal page keeps the sidebar and application chrome:

```text
/terminal
/terminal/<terminalSessionId>
/terminal?catalog=<catalogId>&host=<hostId>&thread=<threadId>
```

`/terminal` opens the terminal's default restore or picker view.
`/terminal/<terminalSessionId>` attaches the Gateway terminal session returned by
`sessions.catalog.startTerminal` or `terminal.open`; encode the ID as one path
segment. The catalog query resumes the native CLI thread identified by the same
`catalog`, `host`, and `thread` values used by native catalog links. Encode query
values with `URLSearchParams`. An explicit terminal session ID takes precedence
over a catalog query.

Starting a native CLI from New session replaces the draft URL with its terminal
session URL. Catalog **Open in terminal** actions open the catalog query form.
Leaving the terminal page preserves its Gateway PTY for reattachment, subject to
the [terminal session lifecycle](/web/control-ui/panels#operator-terminal).

`/terminal` is the normal-route counterpart of `/focus/terminal`, which removes
the sidebar and application chrome. Both require the terminal capability and
operator access. All terminal paths accept the configured Control UI base path.

## Focus presentation routes

A focus route renders one supported content surface without the normal Control
UI application chrome. Focus presentation is separate from browser fullscreen:
opening a focus route does not invoke the browser Fullscreen API.

Insert `/focus` immediately after the configured Control UI base path. Removing
it returns the corresponding normal route when one exists:

```text
/dashboard/roboclaw/the-daily-claw-6d7c9ccb
/focus/dashboard/roboclaw/the-daily-claw-6d7c9ccb

/openclaw/dashboard/roboclaw/the-daily-claw-6d7c9ccb
/openclaw/focus/dashboard/roboclaw/the-daily-claw-6d7c9ccb
```

Dashboard focus routes use the complete canonical `/dashboard` grammar above:

```text
/focus/dashboard/<agentId>
/focus/dashboard/<agentId>/<sessionRef...>
```

The Control UI removes the focus modifier before passing the dashboard route to
the canonical session resolver. Canonical address replacement and ambiguity
candidate links preserve `/focus`. Missing, ambiguous, and unavailable sessions
remain visible, and the dashboard is not read until the session resolves to a
canonical key.

The other focus targets are:

```text
/focus/terminal

/focus/desktop
/focus/desktop/source/<encodedSource>
/focus/desktop/session/<encodedExactSessionKey>
/focus/desktop/control
/focus/desktop/control/source/<encodedSource>
/focus/desktop/control/session/<encodedExactSessionKey>
```

Encode desktop source and exact-session-key values with `encodeURIComponent` so
each occupies one path segment. Empty source and session values are omitted. If
a native caller supplies both non-empty values, the source form wins. The
optional `control` segment requests initial control; it does not grant control
or authorize the connection.

The focus target and desktop identity or options are path-only. Credentials do
not belong in these URLs. Each target keeps the startup, authentication,
permission, and capability checks of its normal or embedded surface. In
particular, the terminal still requires `gateway.terminal.enabled` and an
`operator.admin` connection.

Stable releases previously emitted `/?view=terminal`. The Control UI accepts
that form only at the application root (or `<basePath>/?view=terminal`) and
immediately replaces it in browser history with `/focus/terminal` under the
same base path, removing the legacy `view` parameter. New links must use
`/focus/terminal`. The query form is not recognized on other application
paths, and the removed desktop and dashboard query forms are not accepted.

`/focus` and unsupported `/focus/*` targets show an error without the ordinary
application shell. They do not open a normal application route.

## Beam share URLs

Beam uploads return a dedicated share path such as:

```text
/beam/fix-the-upload-flow-0123456789ab
```

This route is an adapter into the existing read-only Beam session catalog, not
a separate transcript or storage path. It stays in the browser address bar
while the catalog transcript renders. Normal Gateway authentication still
applies; the URL identifies a Beam row but does not authorize access.

Share links open in chat under the default agent. Sidebar and dashboard navigation
keep the explicit catalog-query URL so the selected agent and view are preserved.

New URLs use the same display-name slug as regular session links, followed by
the first 12 lowercase hexadecimal characters of the 32-character Beam id.
The slug is decorative: bare-id links and stale names still resolve by id, and
the browser replaces the slug with the current title without adding history.
If the title produces no slug, the URL contains only the id prefix.
Twelve characters provide 48 bits; against Beam's 500-row retention
bound, the probability that any pair shares that prefix is about 1 in 2.26
billion. Resolution still never assumes uniqueness: exactly one retained row
must match. A missing prefix shows session recovery links, while an
ambiguous prefix shows the matching rows and asks for a longer id. Any longer
lowercase hexadecimal prefix through the full 32-character id is accepted.
Uppercase, non-hexadecimal, shorter, and longer id suffixes, or extra path segments,
are invalid.

With `gateway.controlUi.basePath: "/openclaw"`, use
`/openclaw/beam/fix-the-upload-flow-0123456789ab`.

## Route table

This table lists every Control UI application route. A dash means the route has
no route-specific URL parameters.

| Plugin tab host     | `/<slug>` when advertised; `/plugin` otherwise | -                         | Generic host: `?plugin=<pluginId>&id=<tabId>`; tab parameters: `?p.<key>=<value>` |

Once plugin tabs are known, a generic `/plugin?plugin=<pluginId>&id=<tabId>` link
for a tab with an available slug is replaced once in browser history with
`/<slug>`, preserving `p.*` parameters and the fragment. Tabs without an available
slug keep the generic URL. Both forms mount the same plugin page inside the
Control UI shell; slugs do not create plugin HTTP routes.
Opening or reloading a slug keeps that destination while the Gateway connects,
even when the browser remembers a chat session. Unknown slugs fall back to chat
after the Gateway supplies its plugin tabs.

Automation links open the exact job independently of the current list filters or
loaded page. Adding `run` opens its run history and highlights the matching loaded
run. A missing job shows the Gateway's lookup error.

Settings routes that use schema-backed deep links accept `?section=<section>`,
`?advanced=1`, and `#<setting-id>`. These values select content within the page;
they do not change the route identity.

Links to Settings sections that moved to another page replace the old URL with
the current destination while keeping the setting anchor. Back returns to the
page before the link, and Forward returns to the current destination.

Model setup links with `?firstRun=1` or `?firstRun=explicit` retain the first-run onboarding flow. Without either marker, `/settings/model-setup` and `/model-setup` redirect to `/settings/model-providers?connect=1`, which opens the connection dialog on Models. The Models page otherwise stays in place while connecting a provider or reviewing Gateway discovery.

The retired General route and its `/config` alias are replaced once with
`/settings/appearance?section=__appearance__#settings-language`. The historical
`#settings-general-model` target instead lands on the Models behavior section.

Memory tabs use the paths in the table instead of `?tab=`. Older Memory links
with `?tab=memories|dreams|settings`, `?tab=dreaming`, `?tab=search`, or
`?section=memory` are replaced once with the corresponding path while keeping
any setting anchor.

Plugin catalog tabs also use paths instead of `?tab=`. Older links with
`?tab=discover|installed` are replaced once with the corresponding path while
keeping other query parameters and the fragment.

Agent selection and its `overview|files|tools|skills|channels|cron|memory`
panels use paths. Older links with `?agent=<agentId>` are replaced once with
the agent path while keeping other query parameters and the fragment.

## Other special documents and startup modes

These Gateway-served documents sit outside the application route table:

- `/?onboarding=1` opens the first-run onboarding presentation.
- `/approve/<approvalId>` opens a standalone approval document. With a base
  path, use `<basePath>/approve/<approvalId>`. The id identifies an approval but
  never authorizes it; normal Gateway authentication still applies. An approval
  notification uses a scope-relative approval path and may add
  `#gatewayUrl=<encoded-ws-url>` when the owning Gateway has
  `gateway.publicOrigin`. The Control UI strips that fragment before
  authentication and applies the normal remote-Gateway handoff below.

Registered exact and prefix plugin HTTP routes can own `/focus` and
`/focus/*`. After plugin authentication and dispatch decline a request, the
Gateway uses those paths as the Control UI focus fallback: unclaimed `GET` and
`HEAD` requests serve the Control UI document, while other methods return
`404`. Every unclaimed method returns `404` when Control UI serving is
disabled. Lookalikes such as `/focused` are not part of the focus fallback.

The approval namespace is reserved ahead of plugin HTTP routes for all HTTP
methods. When Control UI serving is disabled, it returns `404` instead of
falling through to a plugin route.

## Remote Gateway handoff

The Vite development UI can connect to a different Gateway:

```text
http://localhost:5173/?gatewayUrl=ws%3A%2F%2F<gateway-host>%3A18789
http://localhost:5173/?gatewayUrl=wss%3A%2F%2F<gateway-host>%3A18789#token=<gateway-token>
```

URL-encode a full `ws://` or `wss://` value. `gatewayUrl` is accepted only in a
top-level window, stored after load, and removed from the address bar. Prefer
`#token=` because fragments do not enter HTTP request logs or Referer headers.
The legacy `?token=` handoff remains a bootstrap-only credential fallback and
is stripped immediately. Passwords stay in memory only.

When `gatewayUrl` selects another Gateway, the UI does not fall back to local
configuration or environment credentials. Provide the remote Gateway's token
or password explicitly, and use `wss://` behind TLS.
