## Reporting

`qa-lab` exports a Markdown protocol report from the observed bus timeline.
The report should answer:

- What worked
- What failed
- What stayed blocked
- What follow-up scenarios are worth adding

For the inventory of available scenarios - useful when sizing follow-up work
or wiring a new transport - run `pnpm openclaw qa coverage` (add `--json`
for machine-readable output). When choosing focused proof for a touched
behavior or file path, run `pnpm openclaw qa coverage --match <query>`. The
match report searches scenario metadata, docs refs, code refs, coverage IDs,
plugins, and provider requirements, then prints matching `qa suite
--scenario ...` targets. Generated commands preserve declared channel-driver
requirements and separate scenarios with different driver requirements. Without
a driver requirement, non-QA channels use `live` and `qa-channel` keeps its
default driver.

Every `qa suite` run writes top-level `qa-evidence.json`,
`qa-suite-summary.json`, and `qa-suite-report.md` artifacts for the selected
scenario set. Scenarios that declare `execution.kind: vitest` or
`execution.kind: playwright` run the matching test path and also write
per-scenario logs. Scenarios that declare `execution.kind: script` run the
evidence producer at `execution.path` through `node --import tsx` (with
`${outputDir}` and `${scenarioId}` expanded in `execution.args`); the
producer writes its own `qa-evidence.json`, whose entries are imported into
the suite output and whose artifact paths are resolved relative to that
producer `qa-evidence.json`. When `qa suite` is reached through `qa run
--qa-profile`, the same `qa-evidence.json` also includes the profile
scorecard summary for the selected taxonomy categories.

Runtime-axis parity reports preserve each runtime's recorded `pass`, `fail`, or
`skip` outcome. Runtime and transport failures override passing or skipped
outcomes; controlled tool errors remain passable. A tracked `known-harness-gap`
skip can leave the scenario passing when its paired runtime passes, but the
skipped cell stays labeled `skip`. Unexpected skips and pairs with both runtimes
skipped still fail the parity gate. Missing captures are labeled `missing`.

### Scheduled instances and retained observations

Schema v3 evidence gives each scheduled scenario instance its own identity.
Repeated scenario names remain separate instances in scheduling order. An
instance points to its selected result; a null result means no result was
recorded, not a pass.

Native script attempts retain child bundles with their original instance IDs,
selection pointers, and a receipt for the exact producer file. Top-level outcomes
describe the outer scheduled scenarios; nested instances remain inspectable child
detail. A child bundle run on its own still reports its own scheduled outcomes.
The enclosing attempt records its catalog coverage cap separately. Scorecards and
explicit proof checks intersect every enclosing cap without changing child rows
or assertions. Secondary claims never become primary; an empty cap qualifies no
child claims. Historical bundles without a cap retain their original behavior.

Retries retain the original observations and artifacts. The selected attempt
controls effective report counts and coverage, while the gallery keeps retained
rows available for inspection. Selection applies to the whole attempt, not a
mixture of passing rows from different attempts. Independent diagnostics remain
independent. Both full and slim evidence preserve occurrence identities, row
bindings, and artifact receipts; slim output omits detailed execution context.
An enclosing retry changes whether its retained child bundle contributes to
effective evidence. It does not rewrite the child's local selection or raw rows.

Readers continue to accept schema v2 artifacts. Historical rows do not acquire
invented attempt, assertion, runtime, or package identities. Source, package,
protocol, and account facts remain unknown unless the producer records them at
the boundary that owns the observation. A prepared Docker candidate receipt
identifies the candidate manifest and package; it does not prove installation
or runtime behavior.

### Explicit proof requirements

Taxonomy profiles may declare `proofRequirements` with a named owner, acceptance
reference, required or advisory obligation, retry policy, and accepted identity
alternatives. Each alternative names only the source, runtime, package, protocol,
account, or proof-class dimensions it needs. One bound receipt must satisfy an
alternative; facts from unrelated observations cannot be combined.
The `selected-attempt` policy excludes inactive enclosing attempts and their child
bundles. `all-recorded-attempts` retains their assertions when evaluating proof.

A required missing or incomplete assertion remains unqualified. Conflicting
pass/fail assertions retain both outcomes. Known identity mismatches are stale;
missing identity or the wrong proof class is insufficient proof, not an invented
product failure. Advisory requirements remain diagnostic. Profiles without
explicit declarations keep their existing behavior: primary coverage alone does
not create a release requirement.

### Evidence previews

The QA Lab evidence gallery uses recognized file suffixes to select image,
video, JSON, or text previews. A `.log` file remains text even when its free-form
artifact kind contains a media hint such as `gif`. Kind hints still classify
extensionless files and unknown suffixes; the complete kind label is preserved.

`qa confidence-report` keeps `productImpact` and `qaImpact` annotations in their
own Markdown table cells, collapsing whitespace for display. The JSON summary
preserves the annotation values, including internal line breaks.

Treat coverage output as a discovery aid, not a gate replacement; the
selected scenario still needs the right provider mode, live transport,
Multipass, Testbox, or release lane for the behavior under test. For
scorecard context, see [Maturity scorecard](/maturity/scorecard).

### Character and style evaluation

For character and style checks, run the same scenario across multiple live
model refs and write a judged Markdown report:

```bash
pnpm openclaw qa character-eval \
  --model openai/gpt-5.6-luna,thinking=medium,fast \
  --model openai/gpt-5.2,thinking=xhigh \
  --model openai/gpt-5,thinking=xhigh \
  --model anthropic/claude-opus-4-8,thinking=high \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6,thinking=high \
  --model zai/glm-5.1,thinking=high \
  --model moonshot/kimi-k2.5,thinking=high \
  --model google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview,thinking=high \
  --judge-model openai/gpt-5.6-sol,thinking=xhigh,fast \
  --judge-model anthropic/claude-opus-4-8,thinking=high \
  --blind-judge-models \
  --concurrency 16 \
  --judge-concurrency 16
```

The command runs local QA gateway child processes, not Docker. Character
eval scenarios should set the persona through `SOUL.md`, then run ordinary
user turns such as chat, workspace help, and small file tasks. The candidate
model should not be told that it is being evaluated. The command preserves
each full transcript, records basic run stats, then asks the judge models in
fast mode with `xhigh` reasoning where supported to rank the runs by
naturalness, vibe, and humor. Use `--blind-judge-models` when comparing
providers: the judge prompt still gets every transcript and run status, but
candidate refs are replaced with neutral labels such as `candidate-01`; the
report maps rankings back to real refs after parsing.

Candidate runs default to `high` thinking, with `medium` for GPT-5.6 Luna and
`xhigh` for older OpenAI eval refs that support it. Override a specific candidate
inline with `--model provider/model,thinking=<level>`; inline options also support
`fast`, `no-fast`, and `fast=<bool>`. `--thinking <level>` still sets a global
fallback, and the older `--model-thinking <provider/model=level>` form is kept for
compatibility. OpenAI candidate
refs default to fast mode so priority processing is used where the provider
supports it. Pass `--fast` only when you want to force fast mode on for
every candidate model. Candidate and judge durations are recorded in the
report for benchmark analysis, but judge prompts explicitly say not to rank
by speed. Candidate and judge model runs both default to concurrency 16.
Lower `--concurrency` or `--judge-concurrency` when provider limits or local
gateway pressure make a run too noisy.

When no candidate `--model` is passed, the character eval defaults to
`openai/gpt-5.6-luna`, `openai/gpt-5.2`, `openai/gpt-5`,
`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`, `zai/glm-5.1`,
`moonshot/kimi-k2.5`, and `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. When no
`--judge-model` is passed, the judges default to
`openai/gpt-5.6-sol,thinking=xhigh,fast` and
`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8,thinking=high`.
