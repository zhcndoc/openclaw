# Session search

`sessions_search` searches the user and assistant text in visible past sessions. Each result
includes a `sessionKey`, timestamp, role, and a short matching excerpt. Pass the returned
`sessionKey`, `messageId`, and `sessionId` together to `sessions_history` to reopen the matched
context, including retained history from before a session reset. Without `messageId`, history
returns the newest reset-relative tail. An explicit `messageId` that remains in that
current view, including a pre-reset row kept after reset, keeps current-view behavior
and can include later post-reset turns. An explicit `messageId` for a retained
active-path row outside the current view opens that original closed interval and does
not mix later post-reset turns.

Anchored reads use `limit` to bound the surrounding messages and cannot be combined with `offset`.
For SQLite transcript history, a missing or off-path message returns empty history rather than
the newest tail; a `sessionId` that does not belong to the selected session key is rejected.
These rules also apply in local embedded mode, without a running Gateway.

## Visibility and output

Search uses the same configured session visibility rules as `sessions_history`. The default
`tools.sessions.visibility: "all"` permits unsandboxed callers to search sessions across agents on
the Gateway, including other users' conversations. Cross-agent access is on by default and governed
by `tools.agentToAgent`; set `enabled: false` to block ordinary cross-agent access or use `allow` to
restrict agent pairs (requester-owned native subagent and ACP child sessions stay reachable under `tree` or `all`). Set explicit `agent`, `tree`, or `self` when callers need narrower session visibility.
Per-peer DM routing separates conversation context but does not restrict session-tool visibility.

Results outside the caller's effective visibility scope are removed before result limits are
applied. Sandboxed agents remain limited to sessions they spawned when spawned-session visibility
is enabled. Incognito sessions remain excluded; narrowing visibility from `all` blocks ordinary
cross-agent access.

Excerpts are redacted before they return to the model. Results are also bounded by count, excerpt
length, and total response size.

## Control UI search

The command palette and Threads page send their session filters to the Gateway, which
searches the full authorized indexed history in that scope. The browser does not download
a session roster to choose which transcripts to search, and a roster page size does not
exclude older matching sessions.

The command palette also finds agent-created conversations assigned to a custom
sidebar group, by title or transcript, after you switch to another conversation.
Ungrouped spawned sessions and subagent runs remain excluded from the palette.
Groups do not grant access to private conversations or include incognito or
archived sessions in active search.

Search returns a bounded set of the best matches. More matches than the result limit is
normal, not an incomplete-index warning; refine the query to narrow the results. Genuine
indexing work and cold archived transcripts excluded from search have separate status
messages. Cold transcript history becomes searchable again when its session is opened
and the history is restored. Search does not restore archived history automatically.

## Index lifecycle

OpenClaw stores a full-text index next to the transcript rows in each agent's SQLite database.
New user and assistant messages are indexed in the same transaction that persists them, so the
index never lags live conversations; tool results, reasoning blocks, and images are excluded.
Only the transcript's active branch is searchable.

Transcripts that predate the index (for example, sessions imported by `openclaw doctor`) and
sessions whose active branch was rewound are reindexed by a background reconciliation that starts
with the next search. A response with `indexing: true` can therefore be incomplete; retry after
indexing finishes. Deleting a session removes its index entries in the same transaction.

Search uses SQLite's Unicode word tokenizer with diacritic removal.

## Session search vs. memory search

Use `sessions_search` for exact words or phrases from raw session transcripts. Use
[`memory_search`](/concepts/memory-search) for durable memory files and semantic recall. The
[experimental session-memory corpus](/concepts/memory-search#session-memory-search) is the semantic
complement to this exact transcript search.
