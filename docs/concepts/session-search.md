# Session search

`sessions_search` searches the user and assistant text in visible past sessions. Each result
includes a `sessionKey`, timestamp, role, and a short matching excerpt. Pass the returned
`sessionKey`, `messageId`, and `sessionId` together to `sessions_history` to reopen the matched
context, including retained history from before a session reset. Without `messageId`, history
returns the newest reset-relative tail. An explicit `messageId` that remains in that
current view, including a pre-reset row kept after reset, keeps current-view behavior
and can include later post-reset turns. An explicit `messageId` for a retained
active-path row outside the current view opens that original closed interval and does
not mix later post-reset turns.

Anchored reads use `limit` to bound the surrounding messages and cannot be combined with `offset`.
For SQLite transcript history, a missing or off-path message returns empty history rather than
the newest tail; a `sessionId` that does not belong to the selected session key is rejected.
These rules also apply in local embedded mode, without a running Gateway.

## Visibility and output

Search uses the same configured session visibility rules as `sessions_history`. The default
`tools.sessions.visibility: "all"` permits unsandboxed callers to search sessions across agents on
the Gateway, including other users' conversations. Cross-agent access is on by default and governed
by `tools.agentToAgent`; set `enabled: false` to block ordinary cross-agent access or use `allow` to
restrict agent pairs (requester-owned native subagent and ACP child sessions stay reachable under `tree` or `all`). Set explicit `agent`, `tree`, or `self` when callers need narrower session visibility.
Per-peer DM routing separates conversation context but does not restrict session-tool visibility.

Results outside the caller's effective visibility scope are removed before result limits are
applied. Sandboxed agents remain limited to sessions they spawned when spawned-session visibility
is enabled. Incognito sessions remain excluded; narrowing visibility from `all` blocks ordinary
cross-agent access.

Excerpts are redacted before they return to the model. Results are also bounded by count, excerpt
length, and total response size.

## Index lifecycle

OpenClaw stores a full-text index next to the transcript rows in each agent's SQLite database.
New user and assistant messages are indexed in the same transaction that persists them, so the
index never lags live conversations; tool results, reasoning blocks, and images are excluded.
Only the transcript's active branch is searchable.

Transcripts that predate the index (for example, sessions imported by `openclaw doctor`) and
sessions whose active branch was rewound are reindexed by a background reconciliation that starts
with the next search. A response with `indexing: true` can therefore be incomplete; retry after
indexing finishes. Deleting a session removes its index entries in the same transaction.

Search uses SQLite's Unicode word tokenizer with diacritic removal.

## Session search vs. memory search

Use `sessions_search` for exact words or phrases from raw session transcripts. Use
[`memory_search`](/concepts/memory-search) for durable memory files and semantic recall. The
[experimental session-memory corpus](/concepts/memory-search#session-memory-search) is the semantic
complement to this exact transcript search.
