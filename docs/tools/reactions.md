title: "Reactions"

The agent adds and removes emoji reactions with the `message` tool's `react`
action. Behavior varies by channel.

## How it works

```json
{
  "action": "react",
  "messageId": "msg-123",
  "emoji": "thumbsup"
}
```

- `emoji` is required when adding a reaction.
- Set `emoji` to an empty string (`""`) to remove the bot's reaction(s) on
  channels that support it.
- Set `remove: true` to remove one specific emoji (requires non-empty
  `emoji`).
- `clearAll: true` is a Feishu/Lark-only flag that removes every reaction the
  bot placed on the message. It is paired with an empty `emoji`.
- `emoji-list` is a separate `message` tool action, not a `react` parameter. It
  reports the emoji a channel will accept. What it returns and which
  per-channel action toggle enables it both vary by channel. See the channel
  pages under [Channels](/channels).
- On channels with status reactions, `trackToolCalls: true` on a reaction lets
  the runtime reuse that reacted message for the same turn's status lifecycle.
  Discord keeps the chosen reaction stable during work and signals actual
  failures, rather than cycling through tool-specific emoji.

## Channel behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discord and Slack">
    - Empty `emoji` removes all of the bot's reactions on the message.
    - `remove: true` removes just the specified emoji.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Nextcloud Talk">
    - Adding reactions only: `emoji` is required and must be non-empty.
    - Reaction removal is not wired to a delete call yet. `remove: true` is rejected with an explicit error instead of silently no-oping.
    - Requires the Talk bot registered with the `reaction` feature (see [Nextcloud Talk channel docs](/channels/nextcloud-talk)).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Telegram">
    - Use `emoji-list` to find allowed standard reactions and numeric custom emoji identifiers. On Telegram, `channels.telegram.actions.reactions` gates both `react` and `emoji-list`, and `emoji-list` returns the reactions allowed in the current chat.
    - Empty `emoji` removes the bot's reactions.
    - `remove: true` also removes reactions but still requires a non-empty `emoji` for tool validation.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WhatsApp">
    - Empty `emoji` removes the bot reaction.
    - `remove: true` maps to empty emoji internally (still requires `emoji` in the tool call).
    - WhatsApp has one bot reaction slot per message. Sending a new reaction replaces it rather than stacking multiple emoji.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Zalo Personal (zalouser)">
    - Requires non-empty `emoji` for both add and remove.
    - `remove: true` removes that specific emoji reaction.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Feishu/Lark">
    - Uses the same `react` action as other channels (add/remove/list via message reaction IDs), not a separate tool.
    - Adding requires non-empty `emoji` (mapped to a Feishu `emoji_type`, e.g. `SMILE`, `THUMBSUP`, `HEART`).
    - `remove: true` requires non-empty `emoji` and removes the bot's own reaction matching that emoji type.
    - Empty `emoji` with `clearAll: true` removes all of the bot's reactions on the message.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Signal">
    - `channels.signal.reactionNotifications` controls inbound reaction notifications. `"off"` disables them. `"own"` (default) emits events when users react to bot messages. `"all"` emits events for all reactions. `"allowlist"` emits events only for senders in `channels.signal.reactionAllowlist`.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="iMessage">
    - Outbound reactions are iMessage tapbacks (`love`, `like`, `dislike`, `laugh`, `emphasize`, and `question`). `emoji` must map to one of these kinds to add a reaction.
    - `remove: true` without a recognized tapback kind removes all tapback kinds. With a recognized kind it removes just that one.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reaction level

Per-channel `reactionLevel` throttles how often the agent sends its own
reactions. Values: `off`, `ack`, `minimal`, or `extensive`.

- [Telegram reaction level](/channels/telegram#feature-reference) - `channels.telegram.reactionLevel` (default `minimal`)
- [WhatsApp reaction level](/channels/whatsapp#reaction-level) - `channels.whatsapp.reactionLevel` (default `minimal`)
- [Signal reactions](/channels/signal#reactions-message-tool) - `channels.signal.reactionLevel` (default `minimal`)
