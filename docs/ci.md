CI continues during Full Release Validation; the legacy release-priority variable
does not pause workflow admission. See [deferred CI recovery](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/.agents/skills/release-openclaw-ci/SKILL.md#deferred-ci-recovery)
for runs already deferred by older workflow revisions.

Native video smoke coverage uses four shards of four providers. Each provider has a ten-minute operation timeout plus 30 seconds of test overhead; each shard has a 50-minute job budget, leaving eight minutes for setup. These shards keep full-mode video testing disabled.

Broad PRs retain their compact selected-owner Node plan when time-based splitting
would exceed the 130-row matrix cap. See [Node test lanes](/ci/scope-and-routing/node-test-lanes).

This page is an index. CI is documented on nine pages, one per reader
job. Open the page that matches your task.

Full hybrid extension lint packs the same canonical chunks into three existing rows, sharing setup and SDK preparation within each row. Targeted plans and frozen routes retain their existing layout; see [runner profiles](/ci/runners#runner-backend-modes).

[Automation admission](/ci/scheduled-workflows#comment-automation) filters known
no-op events before runner allocation and concurrency, keeping automation on
GitHub-hosted runners.

First-attempt PR Node matrices let the scoped monitor classify failures before
cancelling eligible same-repository work. Fork monitoring is read-only. Exact
known hourly-main test and supported static failures can remain advisory when the PR leaves their
subjects unchanged and all remaining checks finish. Retries retain native matrix
fail-fast. Main and manual runs retain complete matrices. See
[failure cancellation](/ci/pipeline#fail-fast-order).

First-hop compatibility uses a 3,200-second container budget and a 3,500-second lane
budget, based on hosted 4-vCPU measurements with a slow-host margin. The release
self-upgrade job allows 130 minutes for two waves of six source versions plus setup.
Authenticated update restart uses a 2,280-second container budget, a 43-minute lane
budget, and a lane-specific 1,500-second command timeout. Its OpenAI/recovery chunk
allows 160 minutes for the npm-serialized lanes plus setup; see
[release-path chunks](/ci/release-validation/install-smoke-and-docker-e2e#release-path-chunks).

For the published-upgrade regression gate, see [selection and routing](/ci/scope-and-routing#scope-and-routing), [runner budgets](/ci/capacity#runner-registration-budget), and [Package Acceptance baselines](/ci/release-validation#suite-profiles). Weekly validation is listed under [Update Migration](/ci/scheduled-workflows#update-migration).

Full `main` CI and cache warming are [hourly by default](/ci/scheduled-workflows#hourly-main-ci); `OPENCLAW_CI_ON_PUSH=true` restores their existing per-push admission. CodeQL, Workflow Sanity, and CI's `security-fast` keep their existing main-push scopes. Docs-only `main` pushes still skip the CI workflow and push-triggered cache warming. The cache warmer publishes dependencies independently of long builds and maintains a bounded hosted seed in hybrid mode. Every admitted canonical `main` run exercises one published-driver × candidate Docker upgrade; ordinary manual/release validation adds the other five Docker seed lanes. QA Smoke, real-Gateway browser checks, and named process proofs retain their selected `main` coverage and manual/release validation. Pull requests and exact-head PR fallback dispatches run static correctness gates, owner-bounded tests, transitive import consumers, protected regressions, and a six-file runtime smoke set. Node rows target at most 150 estimated test seconds. Single files and indivisible canonical groups can exceed that target; setup, builds, and queues are separate from test time. Node shards selecting sandbox container E2E cases prepare the Docker sandbox image when the runner does not already have it. Missing or unbounded runtime selection fails preflight instead of falling back to every test. Windows, browser, Docker, QA Smoke, packaging, contract, and extension families opt in through their existing owners; individual built-process proofs have independent owner flags. Full static fallback does not widen them. The [PR-exempt integration tier](/ci/scope-and-routing/node-test-lanes) retains measured slow tests in hourly `main` and Full Release Validation, with PR opt-in when their tests or subjects change. The existing Plugin Prerelease workflow owns complete extension runtime coverage hourly and in Full Release Validation; normal CI selects affected extension owners on PRs. Windows retains its complete inventory across five measured file shards on hourly main and ordinary manual/release validation; Windows-owner PRs retain that complete inventory.

Hourly iOS retains `ios-build (tests)` with Rust, voice, native Access, and focused lifecycle coverage. Managed attachment UI/export, Watch operation, and Watch delivery UI suites retain every assertion in full manual/release validation. Main-tier simulator builds use the native architecture without indexing or verbose test diagnostics; logs and xcresult bundles remain available. A coalesced scheduled iOS cancellation can leave `openclaw/ci-gate` green with a notice delegating iOS proof to a later scheduled job; it does not validate the canceled revision, and the workflow can still be canceled. Genuine failures remain red. Screenshot capture runs for its own changed inputs and full manual/release validation. See [scope selection](/ci/scope-and-routing/selection) and [capacity](/ci/capacity#owner-path-and-release-coverage) for the coverage trade-off.

iOS screenshot shards, release qualification, Store Release, and its screenshot-only operation use [larger hosted capacity](/ci/runners). Screenshot capture uses stock simulators and creates and cleans up one at a time; the screenshot-only operation can validate a selected branch without signing or uploading a release. The pairing, chat, and native Overview tests retain their existing assertions and deadlines.

Eligible core-source and core-test PRs use targeted type checks when every selected path exists in the checkout. GitHub and hybrid profiles distribute the selected consumers across their existing core stripes; the Blacksmith profile checks them in the central row. Ambiguous ownership and deleted core tests keep the full type-check coverage.

Preflight passes the complete changed-path manifest between steps as a local JSON
file, so large PRs do not lose test-planning inputs to Actions output or environment
size limits. Frozen targets that predate this transport retain their bounded JSON
output contract. Missing or invalid inputs still reject current PR Node planning.

The [Testbox check workflow](/ci/local-proof#testbox-validation) requests the Blacksmith 32-class for dispatched proof and defaults to a four-hour outer job budget. PR hydration checks stay on hosted Ubuntu; individual test deadlines remain unchanged.

Full GitHub and hybrid type checks run the five core stripes independently, retaining two compiler children per job. Current hybrid full runs use three hosted extension-lint jobs; targeted layouts retain six stripe identities. Trusted hybrid first attempts place both packed core-lint rows on the Blacksmith 16-class and the final gate on the 4-class to avoid serial hosted assignment delays. Frozen targets keep their earlier layout; see [static checks](/ci/runners#runner-backend-modes).

Additional checks start directly after preflight. Known full compiler selections skip discovery while retaining the core graph boundary in an existing required owner; see [pipeline ordering](/ci/pipeline#fail-fast-order).

The extension package boundary row has a 30-minute job budget for SDK preparation,
all selected plugin compiles, input-receipt validation, the required negative
canary, and cleanup. Hosted four-CPU runs spent about 19 minutes in the compile
command alone; one completed compile and canary but exceeded the former
20-minute whole-job deadline. Other additional-check rows retain 20 minutes.
This changes no compiler concurrency, coverage, runner routing, or cache guards.

Core lint discovers separate source and UI TypeScript projects, retaining shared ambient declarations and imported dependencies. The source project also includes `src/**/*.test-support.cjs`; unrelated JavaScript files are not added as roots. See [local checks](/ci/local-proof#local-equivalents).

Runtime topology checks inherit the existing [Go memory defaults](/ci/local-proof#local-equivalents), with caller overrides and the full architecture check sequence retained.

Android native resource preparation uses the Mermaid renderer's filtered dependency install, including optional build tooling. Pnpm retains root dependencies but omits unrelated plugin packages; Gradle still builds the assets and runs the selected native tests and lint. Historical targets keep their compatibility path.

Android phone tests use up to two isolated JVMs on Blacksmith and retain [Gradle-owned cache expiry](/ci/runners#runner-backend-modes). The same four normal rows keep third-party phone lint with its unit tests so they reuse compilation and build metadata. Wear owns Wear tests and lint, and Kotlin lint owns Play/shared lint. Normal same-repository Blacksmith runs overlap all four rows; other routes retain two. All test and lint tasks remain selected.

macOS Swift CI runs the app and independent package suites in separate [native phases](/ci/pipeline#macos-swift-phases), retaining every test and the existing concurrency and timeout limits.

Native test builds retain coverage and source-line backtraces while omitting IDE indexes and full debugger type metadata. Local development builds keep their normal debug settings.

Short hybrid jobs use a [40-row base threshold and 45-row hosted admission limit](/ci/capacity#bounded-hybrid-hosted-offload), with unchanged coverage and Blacksmith fallback when optional work does not fit.

Additional hybrid check offloads require [fresh hosted assignment evidence](/ci/runners#hybrid-hosted-assignment-guard). Eligible PRs can move five measured checks; main pushes can also move lint and central types within the same hosted row limit. Artifact builds retain Blacksmith because their measured hosted tail leaves no room for the [15-minute routing objective](/ci/routing-costs).

Windows keeps its complete explicit test inventory in five [measured project-aligned shards](/ci/runners#runner-backend-modes) for main and release validation. Windows-owner PRs retain the complete family; unrelated PRs omit it.

Real-Gateway browser checks use [job budgets matched to their selected runner](/ci/runners#blacksmith-runner-capacity).

Control UI CI installs the Chromium revision pinned by Playwright even when the browser cache misses. Current targets use the installer's `--require-playwright-chromium` mode; historical targets retain their existing installer. Browser startup diagnostics include provider, page, WebSocket, and Chromium process events to diagnose a session-readiness timeout even when it is reported only after unrelated unit work finishes.

Browser extension CI launches the installed, patched Chrome MCP dependency directly, on Node and on the pinned Bun fork.

Build, QA and test orchestration restore the same [protected Node compile cache](/ci/scope-and-routing/node-test-lanes). The trusted warmer populates build tools before collecting test imports, including the same seven Control UI seed files on Node and the pinned Bun fork in both Linux cache backends; ordinary CI remains restore-only.

In-process Gateway test configs use [exclusive plan admission within existing packed jobs](/ci/capacity#measured-shard-weights).

Changed-owner Node rows use existing file/group timing evidence with a
150-test-second admission target and the existing 130-row PR cap. Complete files,
canonical configs, and worker policies remain intact; predicted test seconds
are separate from measured CI wall time.

Plugin-sensitive PRs select their owner tests, transitive import consumers,
protected regressions, and policy watches. The existing Plugin Prerelease workflow retains complete
extension coverage hourly and in Full Release Validation; see
[Node test lanes](/ci/scope-and-routing/node-test-lanes).

Roomy serial Blacksmith Node jobs use [measured Vitest worker sizing](/ci/capacity#vitest-worker-sizing), with existing hosted, frozen-target, and overlapping-plan limits.

Source-only Linux Node shards can reuse content-validated compiled workers from the protected warmer; [fixed preparation costs](/ci/capacity#fixed-job-preparation) remain separate from test execution and runner capacity.

Changed-target shards containing canonical E2E tests prepare the private-QA
runtime once before launching test children. Only a successful preparation step
enables prebuilt consumption, so the children reuse its JavaScript, assets, and
freshness stamps instead of starting another full build.

Vitest transform-cache fingerprints exclude the generated `.ci-harness` checkout so CI consumers and the protected warmer hash the same source inputs. Node bytecode caching remains enabled for ordinary Vitest runs; Vitest owns the worker-level coverage safeguard described in [local testing](/reference/test/local#core-commands).

Transform keys also include each project's dependency optimizer directory. This
prevents cached UI imports from mixing separate projects' Lit instances when a
focused run and a full run share the persistent cache.

Linux PR tests use Bun for the measured compatible unit lanes and Control UI
Vitest job. Full Release Validation keeps their Node coverage and runs them on Bun
too; see [test runtime selection](/ci/pipeline#test-runtime-selection).
Both runtimes group uncached, non-isolated UI files by environment in batches
to reduce worker restarts while retaining native shard ownership and worker budgets.

Frozen-target CI loads its Node shard planner, planning helpers, and measured
costs from the pinned `workflow_sha` checkout. Test discovery and execution still
use the candidate source, so current shard budgets do not replace release bytes.

The npm/ClawHub release decision treats normal CI tests, plugin prerelease,
cross-OS, performance, and QA lanes as advisory recorded evidence. Artifact,
install-smoke, survivor, all first-hop compatibility, pack/npm qualification,
package-integrity, and target-resolution proofs remain required. Aggregators follow required inputs;
identity and provenance verification still apply.

For publication, the sealed manifest supplies the SDK evidence digest,
per-package npm decisions, and any approved `OPENCLAW_RELEASE_STABLE_SOAK_WAIVER`
text. Explicit publisher inputs override those defaults; historical manifests
retain their existing input contract. SDK API changes still need an
operator-supplied acknowledgement, and the sealed waiver applies only while the
repository variable still holds the same text. Publishers still validate live authority,
artifact bytes, and registry state at the mutation boundary.

Flaky tests never block npm/ClawHub publication: record advisory failures and
investigate their owners without waiting for a green rerun. A passing replay
alone does not prove a fix. Required artifact, install, update, target, and
provenance proofs remain enforced. Native app publication is fully decoupled
from npm/ClawHub, GitHub finalization, and main closeout; report each platform's
readiness separately. The approximately 20-minute validation and one-hour
publication targets require hosted timing evidence before being claimed.

Release closeout refreshes hosted full-release shard costs with
`node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/ci-shard-timings-refresh.mts --run <ci-child-run-id>`.
The generator records successful hosted job walls, including setup, in the existing
`config/ci-test-timings.json` store. Release keys stay separate from compact CI
spans and survive the daily refit. The hosted full planner splits measured rows
above 12 minutes after file bundling, retaining exact coverage and worker settings.
Complete split generations keep subsequent plans from recombining expensive work.
An indivisible over-budget test fails planning with its owner named; unmeasured
rows still need native timing evidence before claiming the 20-minute objective.

Full Release Validation's exact-target UI job retains the current three native
shards for both runtimes. Historical compatibility targets keep their original
unsharded package command; see [UI job budgets](/ci/scope-and-routing/job-budgets).

Set the repository variable `OPENCLAW_RELEASE_RUNNER_GROUP` to reserve a runner
group for Full Release Validation and its artifact, validation, and reusable
worker jobs. The Release Publish parent and its dispatched publish children read
the same variable. It selects the group; it does not provision runners or increase
concurrency limits. Missing group capacity queues jobs. Shared workflows receive
an optional `runner_group` from their release caller, including `docker-release.yml`
and `vercel-container-registry-publish.yml` from Release Publish; `docker-image-refresh.yml`,
ordinary CI, scheduled performance, and unrelated reusable callers retain their routing.
Approval and credentialed publish jobs (npm trusted publishing, ClawHub, Docker)
keep their default GitHub-hosted labels, and the hourly plugin npm preview routes
only when Release Publish dispatches it.
The runner count, matrix caps, and default labels do not change.

To reserve capacity outside ordinary PR/main pools:

1. Create an org runner group with Linux runners labelled `ubuntu-latest`/`ubuntu-24.04`, plus the Windows/macOS labels used by validation.
2. Grant `openclaw/openclaw` access to the group.
3. Set `OPENCLAW_RELEASE_RUNNER_GROUP` to the group name; unset it to release the reservation and restore ordinary routing.

Linux runners for jobs that set `semantic-checks: true` also require:

- systemd as PID 1 and an active `systemd-logind` service.
- Noninteractive sudo access to check logind, enable linger for the runner user,
  and start that user's systemd manager.
- cgroup v2 with memory and swap accounting, delegated to the user manager.

These requirements apply to custom release groups as well as ordinary runners.
The shared setup action starts the user manager and verifies a real 64 MiB scope
with swap disabled and group OOM termination before checks run. Unsupported
runners fail setup; provision these capabilities before assigning the validation
labels, or unset the release-group override to restore ordinary routing. Setup
qualifies the backend; it does not itself limit later lint or compiler commands.

Full Release Validation starts source-only children alongside artifact producers
after admission and reuse selection. Candidate consumers start as soon as the
candidate is verified, while npm qualification and independent validation can
continue; see the [release procedure](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/.agents/skills/release-openclaw-maintainer/references/regular-release.md).

Release-dispatched validation children add one best-effort hosted receipt job
each, up to seven per full campaign and none for ordinary PR/main CI. It retains
job results independently of parent completion. With `reuse_evidence=true`, each
dispatch checks bounded prior receipts for its exact target and inputs, including
candidate bytes, and adopts only verified successful children. Other roles still
dispatch. Failed, cancelled, and active parents can supply green children; the
current parent seals and revalidates each immutable selection. Discovery adds no
jobs or Blacksmith registrations and falls back to fresh work on a miss.

Auto-reply reply tests run files in parallel with two workers per compact group. Their planner uses separate parallel timing identities; until those have measurements, serial group costs are divided by the effective worker count, with single-file groups retaining their full cost.

The measured Gateway isolated/database-worker cohort uses at most eight workers
on those hosts with at least 28 GiB total memory; other packed groups retain
their existing caps.

Commands tests share the existing worker budget across independent files. The
Doctor session SQLite cases are split by operation while preserving the complete
repair and recovery coverage; see [shard weights](/ci/capacity#measured-shard-weights).

The complete [startup corpus](/ci/pipeline) uses eight state test files so existing workers can share its release/config matrix. Its explicit fallback prepares the runtime once and uses up to four workers, capped by available CPU parallelism; historical frozen targets retain their legacy process layout with CPU-bounded admission.
