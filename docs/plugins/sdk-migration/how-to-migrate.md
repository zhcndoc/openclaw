The ordered migration steps. Work through them in order; each step is self-contained. Part of the [Plugin SDK migration](/plugins/sdk-migration) guide.

## Workspace mutation guards

Await `api.runtime.agent.ensureAgentWorkspace({ dir, guard: { assertHost } })`.
Prepare database-derived inputs asynchronously before calling it; `assertHost`
must synchronously check current caller authority without accessing SQLite.
Core-owned recovery predicates execute on the worker's transaction connection.

The released `beforePersistentApply: () => void` option remains supported for
TypeScript and JavaScript plugins until the next Plugin SDK major. It runs on the
host once immediately before each worker mutation dispatch, outside admission
grants, and at host filesystem mutation boundaries. Throwing stops that apply.
Synchronous OpenClaw database access in the callback is allowed and deprecated;
a warning explains the timing and typed replacement once per process.

There is no compatibility break for legacy callbacks or their database reads.
The timing nuance is that the legacy check runs just before dispatch, while
`guard.assertHost` is also rechecked inside transaction and commit grants.
Prefer the typed guard for live revocation at commit. Callback errors continue
to propagate. No schema, retention, durability, or update migration is required.

## Await Mention Inbox operations

Replace synchronous `context.mentionInbox.list(client)` and
`context.mentionInbox.dismiss(client, ids)` calls with
`listAsync(client, publish)` and `dismissAsync(client, ids, publish)`.
Both methods prepare durable state in workers, then call `publish` synchronously
with the current authorized result. Send the Gateway response inside that
callback without awaiting more work:

```ts
await mentionInbox.listAsync(client, (result) => {
  respond(result.ok, result.ok ? result.value : undefined, result.ok ? undefined : result.error);
});
```

Await the returned promise before releasing request resources or starting work
that depends on the operation. Dismissal IDs retain exact-match semantics.

Replace `recordCommittedInput(input)` with `await recordCommittedInputAsync(input)`
and `invalidate(sessionKey)` with `await invalidateAsync(sessionKey)`. Await
recording before reading the resulting Inbox, and await invalidation before
depending on refreshed connected views.

The shipped `list`, `dismiss`, `recordCommittedInput`, and `invalidate` methods
remain synchronous third-party adapters until the next Plugin SDK major and
explicit breaking-release approval. Each emits a `DEP_SESSION_PERSISTENCE`
deprecation warning once per plugin and method per process; calls outside a
plugin invocation warn once per method. Existing return values and completion
timing stay intact, including recording before an immediate synchronous list.
Notifications publish after the enclosing transaction commits and are discarded
on rollback. This migration changes no schema, retained data, retention, or
update behavior.

## Await session transcript persistence

Use the awaited `SessionManager` methods from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-sessions`. Await each mutation before reading the new
view, publishing its result, starting dependent work, or releasing the session's
write authority:

```typescript
import { SessionManager } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-sessions";

const manager = await SessionManager.openAsync(target);
const entryId = await manager.appendCustomEntryAsync("plugin-checkpoint", {
  stage: "ready",
});
await manager.appendLabelChangeAsync(entryId, "Ready");
```

Here `target` is the session owner's prepared transcript target. The async calls
retain that binding and the caller's live authority across queue waits. File-backed
SQLite persistence uses the existing writer worker and per-session FIFO order.
Append and persisted tree-mutation promises resolve after the manager adopts the
committed result; failed writes reject instead of publishing an uncommitted view. Parent,
leaf, branch, idempotency, and returned-entry semantics stay with the existing
transcript owner. Handle errors before continuing; do not retry an uncertain write
by calling a synchronous method.

| Deprecated synchronous method              | Awaited replacement                             | Resolved result                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appendMessage`                            | `appendMessageAsync`                            | Persisted message entry ID                                                 |
| `appendMessageWithTranscriptAnchor`        | `appendMessageWithTranscriptAnchorAsync`        | Append result, including the entry ID and transcript anchor                |
| `appendCompaction`                         | `appendCompactionAsync`                         | Compaction entry ID                                                        |
| `appendResetBoundary`                      | `appendResetBoundaryAsync`                      | Reset entry ID                                                             |
| `appendCustomEntry`                        | `appendCustomEntryAsync`                        | Custom entry ID                                                            |
| `appendSessionInfo`                        | `appendSessionInfoAsync`                        | Session-info entry ID                                                      |
| `appendCustomMessageEntry`                 | `appendCustomMessageEntryAsync`                 | Custom-message entry ID                                                    |
| `appendLeafControl`                        | `appendLeafControlAsync`                        | Leaf-control record                                                        |
| `appendLabelChange`                        | `appendLabelChangeAsync`                        | Label entry ID                                                             |
| `branch`                                   | `branchAsync`                                   | `void`; prepares the selected branch                                       |
| `branchWithSummary`                        | `branchWithSummaryAsync`                        | Branch-summary entry ID                                                    |
| `removeTrailingEntries`                    | `removeTrailingEntriesAsync`                    | Number of removed entries                                                  |
| `persist`                                  | `persistAsync`                                  | Existing raw persistence result; does not add the entry to the loaded tree |
| `prepareTranscriptRewrite`                 | `prepareTranscriptRewriteAsync`                 | Prepared rewrite; await its `commit(...)` as well                          |
| `SessionManager.appendMessageToTranscript` | `SessionManager.appendMessageToTranscriptAsync` | Persisted message entry ID                                                 |

Hydration follows the same naming convention: replace `open`, `openBounded`,
`openDetachedBounded`, and `openModelContext` with their `Async` static methods;
replace `setSessionTarget` and `reloadPersistedTranscript` with their `Async`
instance methods. See [session transcript hydration](/plugins/sdk-runtime/agent#session-transcript-hydration)
for read limits, cancellation, and target-binding rules. Synchronous getters read
the prepared view. `inMemory()` and `fromEntries()` remain synchronous;
`appendModelChange`, `appendThinkingLevelChange`, and `createBranchedSession`
already return promises and keep their names.

`branchAsync` can hydrate missing history through the read worker before selecting
the branch. `resetLeafAsync(): Promise<void>` orders an in-memory navigation reset
with queued session writes. Neither operation writes a leaf record by itself;
the following append retains the existing branch semantics. `resetLeaf()` remains
supported synchronous in-memory navigation and is not deprecated.

The low-level `persistAsync` mirrors `persist`: it writes a supplied entry and
returns its persistence result without adding that entry to the loaded tree.
Prefer the append methods when the caller needs view adoption; otherwise await
`reloadPersistedTranscriptAsync()` before reading the resulting tree. For a
prepared rewrite, await both `prepareTranscriptRewriteAsync()` and the returned
`commit(rewrittenEntryIds)` before using the rewritten view.

User and custom messages use the worker append path, including appends with
`beforeFreshMessageCommit`; those options do not select synchronous persistence.
Incognito storage is the explicit exception: it remains with its process-local
owner until its worker cutover. Await its calls too so dependent publication
keeps the same ordering. This migration changes no transcript format, schema,
retention, or update/Doctor behavior, and needs no data conversion.

Synchronous methods remain named third-party compatibility adapters. They keep
their existing immediate return values and emit one `DeprecationWarning` per
method per process with code `DEP_SESSION_PERSISTENCE`, naming the
awaited replacement. The
`session-manager-sync-persistence` compatibility record deprecates them on
October 1, 2026, with removal at the next Plugin SDK major
(`next-plugin-sdk-major`); there is no calendar removal deadline. Bundled callers
use the awaited methods. Do not add a sync fallback when adopting the new API.

User-turn transcript recorders also provide optional
`completeProcessingAsync(outcome)` and `waitForPendingInputSettlement()` methods.
Await processing completion before publishing its outcome. Completion records
processing separately from transcript consumption; it does not append or consume
the pending input. The synchronous `completeProcessing` callback shipped in
`v2026.9.8` retains its immediate result for existing SDK consumers. The host
uses that legacy callback only when a supplied recorder has no async companion,
never after an async failure or an undefined async result.

`finishPendingInput(disposition)` still revokes prompt custody synchronously.
After calling it, await `waitForPendingInputSettlement()` when available before
releasing the turn's session admission. This joins accepted completion and
disposition writes, including each original source of a collected input. An
uncertain write outcome is preserved and must not be replayed through either
callback. These additions change no schema, retention, or update behavior.

### Await extension session changes

Extensions should await the new methods before reading or publishing their
effects:

| Deprecated method             | Awaited replacement                                | Resolved result                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ExtensionAPI.appendEntry`    | `ExtensionAPI.appendEntryAsync(customType, data?)` | Persisted entry ID                  |
| `ExtensionAPI.setSessionName` | `ExtensionAPI.setSessionNameAsync(name)`           | `void`                              |
| `ExtensionAPI.setLabel`       | `ExtensionAPI.setLabelAsync(entryId, label)`       | `void`; `undefined` removes a label |
| `AgentSession.setSessionName` | `AgentSession.setSessionNameAsync(name)`           | `void`                              |

The old methods retain their synchronous `void` contract for third-party
extensions. `extension-session-sync-persistence` records their deprecation and
next-Plugin-SDK-major removal gate. The added methods preserve existing source
contracts while allowing the host to await persistence failures and committed
state before continuing. Deprecated calls emit the same once-per-method
`DEP_SESSION_PERSISTENCE` warning.

Custom extension hosts should supply `ExtensionActionsV2` through
`ExtensionRunner.bindCoreAsync(...)`. Binding remains synchronous; the required
actions return promises. `ExtensionRuntimeV2` also requires those actions, while
the original `ExtensionActions`, `ExtensionRuntime`, and `bindCore(...)` contracts
remain source-compatible. `createExtensionRuntime()` retains its original return
type. A new async API called without an async host binding rejects with a
`bindCoreAsync` migration error instead of falling back to synchronous persistence.

### Await provider replay metadata

Implement `ProviderPlugin.sanitizeReplayHistoryAsync` with
`ProviderSanitizeReplayHistoryContextV2`. Its optional `sessionState` is a
`ProviderReplaySessionStateV2`; when present, it supplies the required
`appendCustomEntryAsync(customType, data): Promise<string>` capability. Await
metadata appends before returning the sanitized replay messages. The host prefers
this hook when both versions exist and does not retry a failed async hook through
the legacy one.

For Gemini replay, use `sanitizeGoogleGeminiReplayHistoryAsync(ctx)` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/provider-model-shared`, or the existing
`buildProviderReplayFamilyHooks(...)` builder, which supplies the awaited hook.
The synchronous `sanitizeGoogleGeminiReplayHistory`, legacy
`sanitizeReplayHistory` hook, and `ProviderReplaySessionState.appendCustomEntry`
remain third-party compatibility adapters. The original context types keep their
signatures; the V2 types add the required awaited capability. These surfaces are
recorded as `provider-replay-sync-persistence` for removal at the next Plugin SDK
major. Deprecated calls emit the same once-per-method
`DEP_SESSION_PERSISTENCE` warning. The family builder retains its
legacy hook for supported older consumers. The awaited Gemini helper propagates
metadata write failures; the legacy adapter retains its historical best-effort
metadata behavior.

## Managed node workspace acquisition

Node-host commands should await `context.acquireManagedWorkspaceAsync(request)`
before using the returned workspace and release its lease in `finally`. The host
checks the exact invocation session before and after acquisition, releases a
late lease if the invocation closes, and keeps prepared-workspace SQLite work
off the node's event loop. Continue checking command cancellation before starting
external work.

The synchronous `context.acquireManagedWorkspace(request)` callback shipped in
2026.9.4 remains available for external plugin compatibility and is deprecated.
Its return value stays synchronous. Bundled commands use the async companion;
plugins requiring that companion should report an unavailable host capability
instead of falling back to synchronous acquisition. Removal of the deprecated
callback requires an explicitly approved future breaking Plugin SDK release.
The `next-plugin-sdk-major` gate does not itself authorize removal or shorten
an existing compatibility window.

## Migrate durable ingress files through Doctor

Keep legacy file readers in the plugin's `PluginDoctorStateMigration`, exposed
through its Doctor contract. Declare source directories and the destination
database in `collectBackupResources`; detection remains read-only. Runtime
consumers use canonical SQLite ingress queues.

During repair, trusted channel plugins receive channel-bound access through
`context.channelIngressQueues`. Require `assertCurrent` and
`importLegacyEntries` before changing state; these capabilities expire when the
repair section ends. Use `backupLegacyStateSource({ filePath, assertCurrent })`
from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-doctor-migrations` before parsing or normalizing
the source. It preserves exact bytes in a private, durable `.migrated` file
(or a numbered successor), verifies source identity, and returns the snapshot
plus guarded source cleanup.
During discovery, normalize interrupted claim filenames with
`resolveLegacyMigrationSourcePath`, deduplicate the original paths, and pass each
source's discovered `claimPaths` to the backup helper. It restores interrupted
claims through the shared migration owner before
capturing its snapshot; receipts always use the original source path.

Call `importLegacyEntries({ accountId, entries })` with canonical channel/account
identities. Each item contains an `entry` and `sources`, whose records contain
`sourcePath`, `sha256`, and `size` from the backed-up snapshots. The host commits
pending entries or payload-free failed tombstones together with source receipts
in the existing migration ledger. Equivalent rows and completed work remain
authoritative; conflicting rows receive no completed receipt and keep their
source files. Receipts suppress repeat imports even after queue rows are consumed
or pruned. Changed source bytes form a distinct source generation.
Historical receipt and failure timestamps are preserved. Imported rows start
their mutation age at import time so pending-row pruning cannot discard old
updates before their first replay.

After a successful import or confirmed prior receipt, call
`backup.removeSource(() => { result.markSourcesRemoved([backup.snapshot.sourcePath]); })`.
The shared owner claims the original name, records its removal, then removes the
claim. A failed bookkeeping operation keeps a discoverable source for the next
Doctor pass. The callback must be synchronous. Preserve backups
and report unresolved conflicts with `openclaw doctor --fix` recovery guidance.
After a confirmed commit, cleanup-only failures may return
`warningDisposition: "recoverable"` when current repair authority and retained
source/backup identities still verify. Conflicts, lost authority, and uncertain
imports remain refusals.
Do not implement import as runtime `enqueue` followed by `fail`: an interruption
would expose a historical failure as new pending work.

## Agent roster config

Author agent rosters as `agents.entries`, keyed by agent ID. Entries contain no
`id` field or `default` marker; their insertion order is the roster order. Read
`cfg.agents.entries` directly, or use `listAgentIds` and `resolveAgentConfig` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-runtime`. Select the owner explicitly for the surface
you use, such as `agents.defaults.systemAgent.agentId` for system work.

Authored `agents.list` and boolean entry `default` markers are rejected. Run
`openclaw doctor --fix` to migrate stored legacy configs; Doctor also records
explicit ownership for migrated multi-agent rosters.

Entries also carry no `agentRuntime` or `compaction`. Validation rejects both, so
the authored config type omits them and `resolveAgentConfig` no longer returns
`agentRuntime`. Read runtime policy from per-model `models[ref].agentRuntime` and
compaction settings from `agents.defaults.compaction`.

Plugins built against stable SDK releases through 2026.9.x may still read the
deprecated, non-enumerable runtime `agents.list` projection introduced in
[#113146](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/113146). It is no longer typed
or read internally, is not serialized or copied by `structuredClone`, and is
scheduled for removal after January 2, 2027. Config mutation drafts must read and
write `agents.entries`. This compatibility window adds no runtime warnings.

## How to migrate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Migrate runtime config load/write helpers">
    Bundled plugins should stop calling `api.runtime.config.loadConfig()` and
    `api.runtime.config.writeConfigFile(...)` directly. Prefer config already
    passed into the active call path. Long-lived handlers that need the
    current process snapshot can use `api.runtime.config.current()`. Long-lived
    agent tools should read `ctx.getRuntimeConfig()` inside `execute` so a tool
    created before a config write still sees the refreshed config.

    Config writes go through the transactional helper with an explicit
    after-write policy:

    ```typescript
    await api.runtime.config.mutateConfigFile({
      afterWrite: { mode: "auto" },
      mutate(draft) {
        draft.plugins ??= {};
      },
    });
    ```

    Use `afterWrite: { mode: "restart", reason: "..." }` when the change needs
    a clean gateway restart, and `afterWrite: { mode: "none", reason: "..." }`
    only when the caller owns the follow-up and deliberately suppresses the
    reload planner. Mutation results include a typed `followUp` summary for
    tests and logging; the gateway remains responsible for applying or
    scheduling the restart.

    `loadConfig` and `writeConfigFile` have been removed from the plugin
    runtime. Bundled plugins and repo runtime code are guarded by
    `pnpm check:deprecated-api-usage` and
    `pnpm check:no-runtime-action-load-config`: new production plugin usage
    fails outright, direct config writes fail, gateway server methods must use
    the request runtime snapshot, runtime channel send/action/client helpers
    must receive config from their boundary, and long-lived runtime modules
    allow zero ambient `loadConfig()` calls.

    The broad `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-runtime` barrel has been removed.
    Use the narrow subpath for the job:

    | Need | Import |
    | --- | --- |
    | Config types such as `OpenClawConfig` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-contracts` |
    | Plugin-entry config lookup | `api.pluginConfig` |
    | Config merging | Plugin-local logic at the config boundary |
    | Current runtime snapshot reads | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-config-snapshot` |
    | Config writes | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/config-mutation` |
    | Session store helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/session-store-runtime` |
    | Markdown table config | `api.runtime.channel.text.resolveMarkdownTableMode` |
    | Channel group policy, mention requirements, and sender tool policy | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-policy` |
    | Provider-default group-policy fallback helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-group-policy` |
    | Secret input resolution | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/secret-input-runtime` |
    | Model/session overrides | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/model-session-runtime` |

    `api.pluginConfig` is registration-scoped, not a live getter. Replacing
    `resolveLivePluginConfigObject(...)` requires preserving freshness through
    the current config supplied by the runtime boundary. The injected markdown
    resolver preserves channel/account precedence and channel defaults;
    `markdown-table-runtime` is a private, JavaScript-only host export.

    The named types `TtsMode`, `TtsPersonaConfig`, `TtsPersonaFallbackPolicy`,
    and `SessionResetMode` move unchanged to `config-contracts`. Talk config,
    cron-store operations, context-visibility config resolution, and
    dangerous-name checks lack a complete modern typed-public mapping.
    Adapt plugin-owned behavior or request a focused
    public contract; do not import the private host implementation.

    Bundled plugins and their tests are scanner-guarded against the broad
    barrel so imports and mocks stay local to the behavior they need.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate embedded tool-result extensions to middleware">
    Bundled plugins must replace embedded-runner-only
    `api.registerEmbeddedExtensionFactory(...)` tool-result handlers with
    runtime-neutral middleware:

    ```typescript
    // OpenClaw runtime tools and Codex runtime dynamic tools (result may be
    // transformed). Codex-native tool results are also relayed for observation,
    // but their transformed output never reaches the model: the Codex
    // PostToolUse hook contract cannot replace a native tool response.
    api.registerAgentToolResultMiddleware(async (event) => {
      return compactToolResult(event);
    }, {
      runtimes: ["openclaw", "codex"],
    });
    ```

    Update the plugin manifest at the same time:

    ```json
    {
      "contracts": {
        "agentToolResultMiddleware": ["openclaw", "codex"]
      }
    }
    ```

    Installed plugins can also register tool-result middleware when explicitly
    enabled and every targeted runtime is declared in
    `contracts.agentToolResultMiddleware`. Undeclared installed middleware
    registrations are rejected.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate approval-native handlers to capability facts">
    Approval-capable channel plugins expose native approval behavior through
    `approvalCapability.nativeRuntime` plus the shared runtime-context
    registry:

    - Replace `approvalCapability.handler.loadRuntime(...)` with
      `approvalCapability.nativeRuntime`.
    - Move approval-specific auth/delivery off legacy `plugin.auth` /
      `plugin.approvals` wiring and onto `approvalCapability`.
    - `ChannelPlugin.approvals` has been removed from the public
      channel-plugin contract; move delivery/native/render fields onto
      `approvalCapability`.
    - `plugin.auth` remains for channel login/logout flows only; core no
      longer reads approval auth hooks there.
    - Register channel-owned runtime objects (clients, tokens, Bolt apps)
      through `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-runtime-context`.
    - Do not send plugin-owned reroute notices from native approval handlers;
      core owns routed-elsewhere notices from actual delivery results.
    - When passing `channelRuntime` into `createChannelManager(...)`, provide a
      real `createPluginRuntime().channel` surface - partial stubs are
      rejected.

    See [Channel Plugins](/plugins/sdk-channel-plugins) for the current
    approval capability layout.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Windows wrapper fallback behavior">
    If your plugin uses `openclaw/plugin-sdk/windows-spawn`, unresolved Windows
    `.cmd`/`.bat` wrappers now fail closed unless you explicitly pass
    `allowShellFallback: true`:

    ```typescript
    // Before
    const program = applyWindowsSpawnProgramPolicy({ candidate });

    // After
    const program = applyWindowsSpawnProgramPolicy({
      candidate,
      // Only set this for trusted compatibility callers that intentionally
      // accept shell-mediated fallback.
      allowShellFallback: true,
    });
    ```

    If your caller does not intentionally rely on shell fallback, do not set
    `allowShellFallback` and handle the thrown error instead.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Find deprecated imports">
    ```bash
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/compat" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/infra-runtime" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/config-runtime" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/channel-lifecycle" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/channel-message" my-plugin/
    grep -r "plugin-sdk/channel-reply-pipeline" my-plugin/
    grep -r "openclaw/extension-api" my-plugin/
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace with focused imports">
    Check the exported name and typed-public contract as well as the import
    path. Some functions are renamed; not every removed helper or named type
    has a modern public replacement:

    ```typescript
    // Before (deprecated backwards-compatibility layer)
    import {
      createChannelReplyPipeline,
      createPluginRuntimeStore,
    } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/compat";

    // After (modern focused imports)
    import {
      createChannelMessageReplyPipeline as createChannelReplyPipeline,
    } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-outbound";
    import { createPluginRuntimeStore } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/runtime-store";
    ```

    The explicit alias preserves existing `createChannelReplyPipeline(...)`
    call sites. The modern export is `createChannelMessageReplyPipeline`;
    see [Removed channel facade mappings](/plugins/sdk-migration/import-paths#retained-channel-facade-mappings)
    for the remaining functions and named types.

    For host-side helpers, use the injected plugin runtime instead of
    importing directly:

    ```typescript
    // Before (deprecated extension-api bridge)
    import { runEmbeddedAgent } from "openclaw/extension-api";
    const result = await runEmbeddedAgent({ sessionId, prompt });

    // After (injected runtime)
    const result = await api.runtime.agent.runEmbeddedAgent({ sessionId, prompt });
    ```

    Same pattern for other legacy bridge helpers:

    | Old import | Modern equivalent |
    | --- | --- |
    | `resolveAgentDir` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentDir` |
    | `resolveAgentWorkspaceDir` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentWorkspaceDir` |
    | `resolveAgentIdentity` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentIdentity` |
    | `resolveThinkingDefault` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveThinkingDefault` |
    | `resolveAgentTimeoutMs` | `api.runtime.agent.resolveAgentTimeoutMs` |
    | `ensureAgentWorkspace` | `api.runtime.agent.ensureAgentWorkspace` |
    | session store helpers | `api.runtime.agent.session.*` |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace broad infra-runtime imports">
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/infra-runtime` has been removed. Use the supported
    surface for each operation:

    | Need | Typed-public import or injected API |
    | --- | --- |
    | New system event producers | `api.runtime.system.enqueueSystemEvent` |
    | System event snapshot inspection and consumption | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/system-event-runtime` |
    | Heartbeat wake requests | `api.runtime.system.requestHeartbeat` |
    | Channel activity telemetry | `api.runtime.channel.activity.record` and `.get` |
    | `createDedupeCache`, `resolveGlobalDedupeCache` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/dedupe-runtime` |
    | Safe local-file/media paths, regular-file checks, and symlink-parent checks | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/security-runtime` (itself a deprecated broad barrel) |
    | `fetchWithSsrFGuard`, pinned-dispatcher helpers, `LookupFn`, `SsrFPolicy` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/ssrf-runtime` |
    | Approval request/resolution types | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/approval-runtime` |
    | Approval reply payload and command helpers | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/approval-reply-runtime` |
    | `collectErrorGraphCandidates`, `extractErrorCode`, `formatErrorMessage`, `formatUncaughtError`, `readErrorName`, `toErrorObject` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/error-runtime` |
    | `generateSecureToken`, `generateSecureUuid` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/core` |
    | `parseFiniteNumber`, `parseStrictFiniteNumber`, `parseStrictInteger`, `parseStrictNonNegativeInteger`, `parseStrictPositiveInteger` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/string-coerce-runtime` |

    OpenClaw no longer uses `commandRequiresSecurityAuditSuppressionApproval`
    internally: suppression reads and writes follow ordinary exec policy. The
    SDK export was removed with the compatibility barrel. Remove this call when
    adopting ordinary exec policy; there is no replacement command-text detector.

    These are symbol-specific mappings, not replacements for the whole barrel.
    Private-local entries such as `heartbeat-runtime`, `delivery-queue-runtime`,
    `fetch-runtime`, `runtime-fetch`, and `file-lock` are JavaScript-only host
    exports, not typed third-party APIs. Heartbeat event/summary/visibility
    helpers, pending-delivery drain, transport readiness, concurrency, and file
    locking do not have equivalent modern typed-public mappings here. Adapt
    plugin-owned behavior or request a focused public contract for the missing
    host capability.

    `fetchWithSsrFGuard` is not a drop-in replacement for dispatcher-aware fetch:
    it takes an options object and returns `{ response, finalUrl, release, ... }`,
    not a bare `Response`; callers must release its resources. The named types
    `PinnedDispatcherPolicy`, `GuardedFetchOptions`, and `GuardedFetchResult`
    are not exported by `ssrf-runtime`. Similarly, `dedupe-runtime` does not
    export the legacy `DedupeCache` or `DedupeCacheOptions` names. Migrate type
    usage explicitly rather than assuming a function move also moves its types.

    The error mapping does not cover `hasErrnoCode`, `isErrno`,
    `stringifyNonErrorCause`, `ErrorKind`, or `detectErrorKind`; the last helper
    preserves legacy substring classification. The numeric and random mappings
    likewise do not cover every timer, expiry, hex, fraction, or integer helper.
    Adapt those operations explicitly; the removed imports no longer load.

    Import system event snapshot inspection and consume helpers from
    `openclaw/plugin-sdk/system-event-runtime`: use `peekSystemEventEntries`
    to inspect and `consumeSelectedSystemEventEntries` to consume selected
    snapshots. Replace the legacy `consumeSystemEventEntries` alias with
    `consumeSelectedSystemEventEntries`. Current snapshots carry an
    opaque `id` for one queued occurrence. Preserve it through copies and
    serialization when returning a snapshot to consume. Legacy ID-less callers
    retain structural matching, which can be ambiguous after queue churn. Do
    not treat the ID as persistent or valid across restarts.

    File-lock nesting is owner-scoped. Pass the same `reentrantOwner` only for
    nested acquisitions in one logical operation; omit it for ordinary locking.
    Never use a process-wide constant, because unrelated work would incorrectly
    share the critical section.

    Bundled plugins are scanner-guarded against `infra-runtime`, so repo code
    cannot regress to the broad barrel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate channel route helpers">
    New channel route code uses `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-route`. The older
    route-key names remain as compatibility aliases:

    | Old helper | Modern helper |
    | --- | --- |
    | `channelRouteIdentityKey(...)` | `channelRouteDedupeKey(...)` |
    | `channelRouteKey(...)` | `channelRouteCompactKey(...)` |

    The modern route helpers normalize `{ channel, to, accountId, threadId }`
    consistently across native approvals, reply suppression, inbound dedupe,
    cron delivery, and session routing.

    Channel plugins use `messaging.targetResolver.resolveTarget(...)` for target-id normalization
    and directory-miss fallback,
    `messaging.inferTargetChatType(...)` when core needs an early peer kind,
    and `messaging.resolveOutboundSessionRoute(...)` for provider-native
    session and thread identity.
