The dates and gates that govern when deprecated surfaces become removable. Part of the [Plugin SDK migration](/plugins/sdk-migration) guide.

`pnpm plugin-sdk:surface:check` enforces the latest stable release's committed
typed public surface independently of export-count budgets. Removing a shipped
subpath or named export requires a covering `deprecated`, `removal-pending`, or
`removed` compatibility record with a `removeAfter` date strictly before the
current UTC date; a `removalGate` alone does not authorize removal. Packaged
private runtime facades without a `types` export condition are excluded because
they are not declared typed-public contracts.

## Removal timeline

| When                                                     | What happens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Now**                                                  | Warning-capable deprecated surfaces emit runtime warnings; repository guards reject deprecated SDK imports from core and bundled plugins.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Pending owner decision**                               | Records without `removeAfter` or `removalGate` remain deprecated and ineligible until their owner publishes a gate.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Day after a `deprecated` record's `removeAfter` date** | At 00:00 UTC, that record becomes date-eligible and `pnpm plugins:boundary-report --fail-on-eligible-compat` exits non-zero. The date itself is the final compatibility day.                                                                                                                                     |
| **A `removal-pending` record's `removeAfter` date**      | At 00:00 UTC, the report marks the record due for review and lists its blockers. It does not trigger the compatibility fail flag.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Next Plugin SDK major**                                | `inbound-reply-dispatch`, synchronous plugin keyed stores, memory session inventory readers, synchronous Mention Inbox persistence methods, and synchronous session/extension/provider replay persistence reach their explicit `next-plugin-sdk-major` gate; none is date-eligible before that version boundary. |

The remaining public SDK subpaths below have registry-backed removal windows.
The July 30 rows were removed after their early maintainer-authorized sweep:
unused subpaths were deleted, earlier compatibility aliases were deleted, and
bundled-only modules were demoted to private-local build mappings.

The August 15 compatibility subpaths `agent-config-primitives`,
`channel-logging`, `channel-secret-runtime`, `channel-streaming`,
`group-access`, `matrix`, `text-runtime`, and `zod` were retired early by
explicit SDK-owner approval in August 2026. Use the focused replacements in
the [Plugin SDK subpath catalog](/plugins/sdk-subpaths), and import `zod`
directly from the `zod` package. `inbound-reply-dispatch` remains available
until the next Plugin SDK major.

The beta.5 whole-session-store bridge was retired with explicit SDK-owner
approval on September 30, 2026, ahead of its former October 12 deadline.
The supported-plugin cutoff excludes `v2026.7.1-beta.5` and all releases that
still import those bridge exports or package-root whole-store aliases.
Upgrade affected plugins to scoped row and transcript-identity APIs before
upgrading the host. The `session-store-runtime` subpath and `resolveStorePath`
remain supported; see the [removed session APIs and replacements](/plugins/sdk-migration/removed-surfaces#removed-session-and-transcript-file-apis).

The five compatibility subpaths `channel-lifecycle`, `channel-message`,
`channel-reply-pipeline`, `config-runtime`, and `infra-runtime` were retired
early by explicit SDK-owner approval on September 30, 2026. That decision
supersedes their October 1 gate and external-migration retention blocker; it
does not certify that every external plugin has migrated. Their public exports
and compatibility aliases are removed. Upgrade affected plugins before loading
them on a host containing this removal.

These subpaths remained available in 2026.8.2 under an approved retention
exception. On September 2, 2026, the release maintainer renewed their
`removeAfter` date from September 1 to October 1 for 2026.9.1. The September 30
decision replaces that window. See [channel import mappings](/plugins/sdk-migration/import-paths#retained-channel-facade-mappings)
and [config and infrastructure migration](/plugins/sdk-migration/how-to-migrate)
for replacements and behavioral differences. System-event snapshot inspection
and consumption now use `openclaw/plugin-sdk/system-event-runtime`.

The compatibility subpaths `command-auth`, `discord`, and `telegram-account`
were retired early by explicit SDK-owner approval on October 2, 2026. That
decision closes their compatibility window; it does not certify that every
external plugin has migrated. Their public exports are removed. Upgrade affected
plugins before loading them on a host containing this removal. See the
[command and channel facade replacements](/plugins/sdk-migration/import-paths#removed-command-and-channel-facades).

Bundled-plugin migration does not prove that every external caller can use a
path-only replacement. Migrate the functions with verified typed-public mappings;
adapt the caller where a removed named type or required behavior lacks a
public replacement. Do not substitute a private-local host export. Run
`pnpm plugins:boundary-report` to see the dates, gates, and blockers for the
surfaces your plugin uses.
