## Host hooks for workflow plugins

Host hooks are the SDK seams for plugins that need to participate in the host
lifecycle rather than only adding a provider, channel, or tool. They are
generic contracts; Plan Mode can use them, but so can approval workflows,
workspace policy gates, background monitors, setup wizards, and UI companion
plugins.

Runtime lifecycle registrations can also supply `dispose()` for resources captured
by that registration. Explicitly owned, uncached plugin inspections invoke it on
rollback or release and await cleanup, including invalid asynchronous registration
work. Doctor uses this ownership when loading a context engine for discovery; it
still does not invoke a discovery-only engine factory. `dispose()` must not delete
durable state or disable another registration. Existing raw loader and Gateway
lifetimes do not gain automatic disposal: keep their `cleanup(ctx)` behavior.

Executable CLI command registration also uses an owned, uncached registry. Its
resources remain available through asynchronous registration, command actions,
and their tracked cleanup, then `dispose()` runs. Closing command preparation
before parsing does not release those resources. Return asynchronous work from
registrars and actions; a plugin's disposer must also stop and join any background
work it owns before closing resources that work uses. The CLI's bounded cleanup
grace can report pending work without treating that work as completed.
Standalone programmatic CLI calls and caller-owned Commander programs retain
their existing lifecycle. `cli-metadata` remains inert and accepts CLI descriptors
only; keep its `machineOutput` resolver pure and synchronous.

`registerBoardWidgetContentKind(...)` is for plugins that own a declarative
widget source format. The registration supplies a globally unique lowercase
`kind`, a short label, one capability-scoped plugin surface plus its renderer
resource paths, a synchronous `validateSource(source)` callback, and a
synchronous `composeDocument(...)` callback. Core adds the document shell,
sandbox, theme, and ticket-bound action bridge. Registrations exist only while
their plugin is active; invalid, reserved, or duplicate kinds fail plugin load.
Use `dashboard.dataBindings` and `dashboard.actionVerbs` for host capabilities,
not for renderer registration.

For inline rendering, `resources.readPublicResource(path)` can optionally return
`{ body: Uint8Array, contentType: string }` for the registered resource paths.
These bytes are public: the isolated sandbox listener serves them with no
Gateway credentials. Return only static renderer assets, never user data or
secrets. Unregistered paths and registrations without this callback stay private.
Opting in reserves every declared path in one global sandbox namespace: no other
content kind may declare the same path, even without a public reader. Registration
rejects these collisions regardless of order; only private registrations may
share paths. Public paths must already be canonical URL pathnames, without dot
segments, backslashes, query strings, or fragments. The sandbox host endpoint
`/mcp-app-sandbox` is reserved. These additional path restrictions apply only to
registrations with `readPublicResource`; private paths retain their capability
URL encoding.

A `surface: "tab"` descriptor adds a sidebar tab to the Control UI. Active
plugins' tab descriptors are advertised to dashboard clients in the gateway
hello (`controlUiTabs`), so the tab appears only while the plugin is enabled.
Bundled plugins may ship a first-class dashboard view for their tab; other
plugins can set `path` to a plugin HTTP route (see
`api.registerHttpRoute(...)`) that the dashboard renders in a sandboxed frame.
`icon` is a dashboard icon name hint, `group` picks the sidebar section
(`control` or `agent`), `order` sorts among plugin tabs, and `requiredScopes`
hides the tab from connections lacking those operator scopes:

Bundled plugins whose page already has a matching native Control UI route can set
`placement: "route:<pluginId>"`. The host rejects native-route claims from external
plugins or from bundled plugins whose ID does not own that route. The sidebar opens
the native route while the descriptor is present instead of mounting the generic
plugin-tab page.

For a gateway-protected external tab, register the descriptor `path` under a
same-plugin `auth: "gateway"` HTTP route. After authenticated bootstrap, the browser gets a
short-lived, HttpOnly grant scoped to that plugin and route root so the
sandboxed frame can load without copying the Gateway bearer token into its URL
or JavaScript. The authenticated parent renews the grant while the external tab
is active and before mounting it after navigation or browser resume. It also
probes the grant from the same opaque sandbox before mounting, so browser
privacy modes that block the cookie fail closed with an unavailable panel.
The frame grant accepts only `GET` and `HEAD` and always carries
`operator.read`; `requiredScopes` controls tab visibility but never widens the
cookie grant. Mutations remain on explicit Gateway-authenticated parent or
bearer surfaces. External tabs require HTTPS/Tailscale Serve or a
browser-trusted loopback origin; plain HTTP on a LAN host shows the
secure-context error instead of mounting a panel that cannot authenticate.
Full third-party-cookie blocking also makes gateway-protected tabs unavailable.
As with all native plugin surfaces, the frame remains inside the installed
plugin trust boundary; OpenClaw does not treat installed plugins as mutually
isolated browser security principals.
Cookie grants use the browser's hostname boundary, not its port boundary. Do
not cohost mutually untrusted services on the Gateway hostname, even on other
ports.
Tabs backed by plugin-managed auth keep their direct iframe behavior and do not
request or require this Gateway grant.

```typescript
api.session.controls.registerControlUiDescriptor({
  surface: "tab",
  id: "logbook",
  label: "Logbook",
  description: "Your day as a timeline, built from screen snapshots.",
  icon: "sun",
  group: "control",
  requiredScopes: ["operator.write"],
});
```

Use the grouped namespaces for new plugin code:

- `api.session.state.registerSessionExtension(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.enqueueNextTurnInjection(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.registerSessionSchedulerJob(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.sendSessionAttachment(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.scheduleSessionTurn(...)`
- `api.session.workflow.unscheduleSessionTurnsByTag(...)`
- `api.session.controls.registerSessionAction(...)`
- `api.session.controls.registerControlUiDescriptor(...)`
- `api.agent.events.registerAgentEventSubscription(...)`
- `api.agent.events.emitAgentEvent(...)`
- `api.runContext.setRunContext(...)` / `getRunContext(...)` / `clearRunContext(...)`
- `api.lifecycle.registerRuntimeLifecycle(...)`

The equivalent flat methods remain available as deprecated compatibility
aliases for existing plugins. Do not add new plugin code that calls
`api.registerSessionExtension`, `api.enqueueNextTurnInjection`,
`api.registerControlUiDescriptor`, `api.registerRuntimeLifecycle`,
`api.registerAgentEventSubscription`, `api.emitAgentEvent`,
`api.setRunContext`, `api.getRunContext`, `api.clearRunContext`,
`api.registerSessionSchedulerJob`, `api.registerSessionAction`,
`api.sendSessionAttachment`, `api.scheduleSessionTurn`, or
`api.unscheduleSessionTurnsByTag` directly.

`scheduleSessionTurn(...)` is a session-scoped convenience over the Gateway
Cron scheduler. Cron owns timing and creates the background task record when the
turn runs; the Plugin SDK only constrains the target session, plugin-owned
naming, and cleanup. Use `api.runtime.tasks.managedFlows` inside the scheduled
turn when the work itself needs durable multi-step Task Flow state.

Within session extensions, `openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-sessions` provides the host's
model-selection helpers. Exact provider/model IDs take precedence over case-insensitive
matches; ambiguous references need exact provider and model IDs. Pass the provider
separately when distinct identities share a combined reference. Human-name
matching, alias/date version selection, and case-insensitive glob scopes remain
available.

Session extension SDK and supported TypeBox imports share the host's modules.

The contracts intentionally split authority:

- External plugins can own session extensions, UI descriptors, commands, tool
  metadata, next-turn injections, and normal hooks.
- Trusted tool policies run before ordinary `before_tool_call` hooks and are
  host-trusted. Bundled policies run first; installed-plugin policies require
  explicit enablement plus their local ids in
  `contracts.trustedToolPolicies`, and run next in plugin-load order. Policy ids
  are scoped to the registering plugin.
- Reserved command ownership is bundled-only. External plugins should use their
  own command names or aliases.
- `allowPromptInjection=false` disables prompt-mutating hooks including
  `agent_turn_prepare`, `before_prompt_build`, `heartbeat_prompt_contribution`,
  and `enqueueNextTurnInjection`.

Examples of non-Plan consumers:

| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Budget/workspace policy gate | Trusted tool policy, tool metadata, session projection                                                                                 |
| Background lifecycle monitor | Runtime lifecycle cleanup, agent event subscription, session scheduler ownership/cleanup, heartbeat prompt contribution, UI descriptor |
| Setup or onboarding wizard   | Session extension, scoped commands, Control UI descriptor                                                                              |

<Note>
  Reserved core admin namespaces (`config.*`, `exec.approvals.*`, `wizard.*`,
  `update.*`) always stay `operator.admin`, even if a plugin tries to assign a
  narrower gateway method scope. Prefer plugin-specific prefixes for
  plugin-owned methods.
</Note>

<Accordion title="When to use tool-result middleware">
  Bundled plugins and explicitly enabled installed plugins with matching
  manifest contracts can use `api.registerAgentToolResultMiddleware(...)` when
  they need to rewrite a tool result after execution and before the runtime
  feeds that result back into the model. This is the trusted runtime-neutral
  seam for async output reducers such as tokenjuice.

Plugins must declare `contracts.agentToolResultMiddleware` for each targeted
runtime, for example `["openclaw", "codex"]`. Installed plugins without that
contract, or without explicit enablement, cannot register this middleware; keep
normal OpenClaw plugin hooks for work that does not need pre-model tool-result
timing. The old
embedded-runner-only extension factory registration path has been removed.
