## Managed text models

During interactive setup, OpenClaw installs a pinned, verified `llama-server`
and recommends a model for the Gateway host's available memory, GPU, and disk
space. Recommendations start with Qwen3.5 4B (about 2.7 GB) on eligible 8 GiB
hosts and scale up as hardware permits. See the current
[model recommendations](/plugins/llama-cpp#model-recommendations) for sizes and
selection floors.

To use another model, configure `params.modelPath`, select its `llama-cpp/<id>`
reference, and rerun managed setup. Setup uses that authored route and offers
to download it if needed. Custom models are not subject to recommendation
memory floors. Existing cached GGUFs remain supported; local memory search can
also use [embedding-only setup](/plugins/llama-cpp#set-up-only-local-embeddings).
