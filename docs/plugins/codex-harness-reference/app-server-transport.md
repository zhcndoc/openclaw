How OpenClaw starts and reaches the Codex app-server, and every `appServer` field. Part of the [Codex harness reference](/plugins/codex-harness-reference); [Where each section moved](/plugins/codex-harness-reference#where-each-section-moved) lists every section.

## App-server transport

For ordinary harness turns, OpenClaw starts a managed Codex binary: a newer
Codex you installed yourself, or the one shipped with the official plugin
(currently `@openai/codex` `0.160.0`):

```bash
codex app-server --listen stdio://
```

OpenClaw resolves the shipped `@openai/codex/bin/codex.js` from the
loader-selected plugin root using Node package resolution, including
npm-hoisted and pnpm-linked dependencies. On Windows, Node runs the same package
entrypoint without requiring a `codex.cmd` shim. Set `appServer.command` only
when you intentionally want a different executable.

### Newer installed Codex

ChatGPT gates new models on the Codex version that runs the turn, so OpenClaw
uses a newer Codex from `PATH` (for example `npm i -g @openai/codex`, a Bun
global install, Homebrew, or the standalone installer) when it is safe, and the
shipped binary otherwise. Once per Gateway process it checks the first `codex`
on `PATH` and uses it only when all of these hold:

- It is a native executable or the official `@openai/codex` npm launcher.
  Other wrapper scripts, such as pnpm global shims, are skipped. A `PATH`
  symlink to a macOS desktop-owned binary is also skipped; desktop startup
  keeps its separate permission and auth rules.
- `codex --version` answers with a stable version newer than the shipped one.
  The version check and selection handshake share a four-second budget. A
  managed request with a shorter remaining deadline spends at most half of it
  on selection, reserving the rest for bundled startup. When that budget runs
  out, this process keeps the bundled pin and ignores any late probe success.
  Equal, older, unparseable, and prerelease versions are skipped.
- It has the same major version as the shipped binary. The app-server protocol
  has no negotiated version, so a new major is treated as incompatible. A newer
  release with the same major can still change a request that OpenClaw uses
  after `initialize`; these checks do not detect that. If a newer Codex
  misbehaves, set `appServer.command` to a specific binary or remove the newer
  `codex` from the Gateway's `PATH`.
- A real app-server `initialize` handshake against a throwaway `CODEX_HOME`
  succeeds within the remaining selection budget and reports the same version.
  Its SQLite location is forced into that temporary home through both environment
  and CLI configuration. The presence of system requirements files, managed
  preferences, or legacy managed configuration disables installed selection
  because those sources can override this location. An absent macOS preferences
  domain is not a restriction. No auth or turn is involved.

Otherwise OpenClaw uses the shipped binary. The Gateway logs one line with the
chosen binary, its version, and the reason, for example
`Codex app-server: using installed /usr/local/bin/codex 0.162.1 (newer than bundled 0.160.0)`
or `Codex app-server: using bundled 0.160.0 (installed /usr/local/bin/codex 0.159.0 is not newer)`.

If the selected Codex later fails to start, fails `initialize`, or reports
another version (for example after an in-place upgrade), OpenClaw starts the
shipped binary for that request before any thread or turn exists, logs one
warning, and keeps using the shipped binary until the Gateway restarts. ChatGPT
model discovery reports the selected binary's version as `client_version`, so
the model list matches the binary that runs turns. A Gateway restart repeats the
selection, which picks up Codex installs, upgrades, and removals.

The model list can briefly disagree with the binary after such a fallback. A
fallback only happens after the installed binary already passed the selection
handshake, so these windows are rare:

- A model-list refresh that started before the fallback, including one still
  queued for a catalog worker, finishes with the installed version's list.
- A list fetched before the fallback stays cached until the ChatGPT model rows
  expire (about a minute) and the next refresh runs. A model only the installed
  version offers can be picked in that window, and its turn then runs on the
  shipped binary.
- `openclaw models list --refresh` without a running Gateway selects a binary
  in its own process, so its list can differ from a Gateway started later, for
  example after installing or upgrading Codex in between.

`appServer.command`, `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_BIN`, and remote app-servers
always win; discovery then keeps reporting the shipped version. Login-status
checks, node exec-servers, and the Doctor package check always use the shipped
binary.

Ordinary managed turns with the default isolated agent home prefer this package
selection even when a macOS desktop bundle is installed. When
[Computer Use](/plugins/codex-computer-use) is enabled, or when `homeScope` is
`"user"` and can load native Computer Use state, managed startup instead prefers
the desktop app binary that owns the required macOS permissions. The same
desktop-first rule applies when an isolated agent home's effective Codex config
enables native Computer Use. If no desktop app bundle is installed, OpenClaw
falls back to the package selection. A desktop-first start that finds the
desktop app does not check `PATH`: the shipped binary is its fallback, and
ChatGPT model discovery for that agent keeps reporting the shipped version.

Before cutting over a staged OpenClaw package, run the opt-in managed-binary
check against the candidate installation:

```bash
openclaw doctor --lint --only codex/managed-app-server --json
```

The check is read-only. For every configured Codex agent it applies the same
final command selection as a live harness turn, without a newer installed
Codex, then verifies that a selected package-owned native binary exists and
reports the plugin's exact pinned version. A selected Codex Desktop binary, an
explicit custom command, and a remote app-server are outside this package check.
The command exits nonzero on an error-level finding, so a deployer can reject
the candidate before cutover without changing Codex state or app-server
settings.

Executable handoff and native-config fencing coordinate clients inside one
running Gateway process. Restart the Gateway after another process changes the
native Codex plugin config.

Supervision resolves a separate connection. With no explicit
`appServer` connection settings, it uses managed stdio with `homeScope: "user"`;
the ordinary harness remains managed stdio with `homeScope: "agent"`. Explicit
connection settings are honored by both paths. Set `homeScope: "user"`
explicitly when the ordinary harness should share `$CODEX_HOME` (or `~/.codex`)
with native clients. A private supervised binding uses the supervision
connection regardless of the ordinary harness default. Independent App Server
processes retain separate live status and approval state.

For non-production testing against an already-running app-server, WebSocket
transport is available:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          appServer: {
            transport: "websocket",
            url: "ws://gateway-host:39175",
            authToken: "${CODEX_APP_SERVER_TOKEN}",
            requestTimeoutMs: 60000,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Codex classifies WebSocket transport as experimental and unsupported. Prefer
managed stdio or the local Unix control socket for production workloads.

`appServer.args` accepts an array (recommended) or a quoted argument string.
`OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_ARGS` uses the same string parsing on every platform:
single and double quotes group words, backslashes and `#` stay literal, and an
unfinished quote groups the remaining text. This preserves the string grammar
shipped in `v2026.9.1`; strings do not use shell escaping.

Use array entries for values containing embedded quotes, such as
`'model="gpt-5.6-luna"'`. For a directory containing a literal backslash, both
forms below pass the same path to Codex:

```json5 validate=false
args: "app-server --listen stdio:// -c log_dir=/tmp/openclaw\\logs"
```

```json5 validate=false
args: ["app-server", "--listen", "stdio://", "-c", "log_dir=/tmp/openclaw\\logs"]
```

The `\\` in JSON5 encodes one backslash. Array entries preserve embedded quotes
and backslashes, but surrounding whitespace is trimmed and empty entries are
omitted. Strings also omit empty quoted arguments. Account for these limits
before converting existing strings to arrays.

`appServer.serviceTier` is used only when no shared Fast-mode run control is
supplied. On Codex harness turns, shared Fast on starts from `priority`, Fast off
sends `null` to clear the OpenClaw-owned tier, and auto decides for each model
call. `/codex fast off` is separate: it persists `flex` in the bound native
conversation preference for later conversation-bound turns and does not change
the shared OpenClaw session policy. These values describe native configuration
and preference state, not observed provider routing.

Ultrafast requires an effective shared Fast-mode selection of `"ultrafast"`.
Select it in the Control UI, use `/fast ultrafast`, supply `fastMode: "ultrafast"`
in a session or run control, or author `fastModeDefault: "ultrafast"` in config.
An unset `appServer.enableUltrafast` or `true` allows this explicit selection.
Set `appServer.enableUltrafast: false` to hide Ultrafast for the Codex runtime in
the picker. Even a saved or explicit Ultrafast selection then sends ordinary Fast
(`priority`) and skips the Ultrafast catalog check.

Only an explicit Ultrafast selection with the switch enabled checks the selected
native model's `serviceTiers` through that turn's authenticated Codex app-server
connection. Models whose catalog does not advertise the tier, custom model
providers, and unavailable catalogs fall back to Fast (`priority`). The native
catalog can contain offline fallback metadata, so this turn-time check does not
establish account entitlement. The Control UI requires separate authenticated
account-discovery evidence before showing Ultrafast. The saved preference is not
a guarantee of the upstream tier honored for the request.

Fast (`true`), active Auto, and unspecified shared run controls never automatically
upgrade or perform an Ultrafast catalog lookup. They keep their baseline tier
(`priority` for Fast or active Auto); a native `serviceTier: "ultrafast"` also
starts from `priority` until the shared selection explicitly requests Ultrafast.
Standard (`false`) and inactive Auto remain off.

`appServer.networkProxy` is explicit because it changes the Codex sandbox
contract. When enabled, OpenClaw also sets `features.network_proxy.enabled` and
`default_permissions` in the Codex thread config so the generated permission
profile can start Codex-managed networking. OpenClaw generates a
collision-resistant `openclaw-network-<fingerprint>` profile name from the
profile body by default; use `profileName` only when a stable local name is
required.

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        config: {
          appServer: {
            approvalPolicy: "never",
            sandbox: "workspace-write",
            networkProxy: {
              enabled: true,
              domains: {
                "api.openai.com": "allow",
                "blocked.example.com": "deny",
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Hosts absent from the effective native allowlist are denied. The example's
`approvalPolicy: "never"` prevents approval-based exceptions; native system
requirements can still contribute allowed domains. These restrictions apply to
Codex sandbox commands. See the [network proxy configuration reference](/plugins/codex-harness/config-fields)
for matching, policy inheritance, scope, and explicit Doctor repair of blank optional fields after updates.

If the normal app-server runtime would be `danger-full-access`, enabling
`networkProxy` uses workspace-style filesystem access for the generated
permission profile instead. Codex-managed network enforcement is sandboxed
networking, so a full-access profile would not protect outbound traffic.

The plugin ships stable Codex app-server `0.160.0` and prefers a newer
installed Codex only under the rules in
[Newer installed Codex](#newer-installed-codex). Explicit custom
executables, remote app-servers, and macOS desktop binaries must report a
parseable semantic version of `0.149.0` or newer. Older, malformed, and
unversioned handshakes are rejected. Newer versions log a compatibility warning
and continue through normal runtime and capability validation.

OpenClaw treats non-loopback WebSocket app-server URLs as remote and requires
identity-bearing WebSocket auth through `appServer.authToken` or an
`Authorization` header. `appServer.authToken` and each `appServer.headers.*`
value can be a SecretInput; the secrets runtime resolves SecretRefs and env
shorthand before OpenClaw builds app-server start options, and unresolved
structured SecretRefs fail before any token or header is sent.

When native Codex plugins are configured, OpenClaw caches one
runtime-and-workspace-scoped `plugin/installed` snapshot. This snapshot covers
installed plugins from Codex-discovered marketplaces, including disabled ownership;
`plugin/read` resolves only exact configured plugin identities. Failed or
incomplete installed snapshots are never cached. `/codex plugins available`
queries `plugin/list` for the current conversation workspace, while
`/codex plugins install <plugin>@<marketplace>` installs only after an owner or
`operator.admin` explicitly authorizes that plugin. Existing explicitly
configured curated plugins retain their automatic recovery path. The model's
plugin-discovery tool cannot install, enable, or authenticate a plugin.

`app/installed` reports installed app runtime state, and `app/read` returns
authenticated metadata for at most 100 requested app IDs per call. OpenClaw
force-refreshes the first cold installed snapshot and consolidates successful
curated installations into one app-inventory refresh. Later cached reads do
not force repeated connector refreshes.

Deny-by-default Codex app policy is evaluated per thread, so an explicitly
allowed app can be installed and authenticated before it becomes callable.
OpenClaw provisionally admits only ownership-proven, policy-approved apps,
creates the thread with `_default.enabled = false` and explicit app overrides,
then calls `app/installed` once with that thread's ID and `forceRefresh: false`.
If that snapshot reports missing, disabled, or non-callable apps, OpenClaw logs
one warning and continues with the remaining tools. Codex still enforces
managed restrictions, workspace policy, and app/tool permissions; unavailable
apps gain no access.

The check completes before OpenClaw injects history, starts a turn, or
persists the native thread binding. If the snapshot request fails, OpenClaw deletes a persistent
provisional thread with `thread/delete` or unsubscribes an ephemeral thread
with `thread/unsubscribe`. If safe cleanup cannot be confirmed, it retires the
owning app-server connection. Supervised branches also clean up their temporary
check and retain recovery state when cleanup fails.

With `allow_all_plugins`, an explicitly disabled configured workspace plugin
still denies its owned apps. When `app/read` does not expose that ownership,
OpenClaw uses its `plugin/installed` snapshot and reads only the exact
configured plugin's details to reserve the denied app IDs. It does not scan
unrelated marketplaces or install, enable, or authenticate the disabled plugin;
missing ownership fails closed.

Only connect OpenClaw to a `0.149.0` or newer remote app-server trusted to accept
configured marketplace plugin installs and inventory refreshes. Missing modern
inventory methods and server, authentication, or transport failures fail closed.

## Environment overrides

Environment overrides remain available for local testing:

- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_BIN`
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_ARGS`
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_MODE=yolo|guardian`
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_APPROVAL_POLICY`
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_SANDBOX`

`OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_BIN` bypasses the managed binary when
`appServer.command` is unset.

`OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_GUARDIAN=1` was removed in 2026.4.22. Use
`plugins.entries.codex.config.appServer.mode: "guardian"` instead, or
`OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_MODE=guardian` for one-off local testing. Config is
preferred for repeatable deployments because it keeps the plugin behavior in
the same reviewed file as the rest of the Codex harness setup.
