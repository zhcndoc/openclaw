The registration call itself, and the two optional capabilities a registered harness can add: one fresh tool-free inference call, and consent for a trusted delegate to execute an existing model-locked session. Part of the [Agent harness plugins](/plugins/sdk-agent-harness) reference.

## Register a harness

**Import:** `openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-harness`

```typescript
import type { AgentHarnessV2 } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-harness";
import { definePluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry";

const myHarness: AgentHarnessV2 = {
  id: "my-harness",
  label: "My native agent harness",

  supports(ctx) {
    const routeSupportsHarness =
      ctx.modelProvider?.runtimePolicy?.compatibleIds.includes("my-harness") === true;
    const canReproduceRequest = ctx.modelProvider?.requestTransportOverrides !== "present";
    return ctx.provider === "my-provider" && routeSupportsHarness && canReproduceRequest
      ? { supported: true, priority: 100 }
      : { supported: false, reason: "effective route is not harness-compatible" };
  },

  async runAttempt(params) {
    // Start or resume your native thread.
    // Use params.prompt, params.tools, params.images, params.onPartialReply,
    // params.onAgentEvent, and the other prepared attempt fields.
    return await runMyNativeTurn(params);
  },
};

export default definePluginEntry({
  id: "my-native-agent",
  name: "My Native Agent",
  description: "Runs selected models through a native agent daemon.",
  register(api) {
    api.registerAgentHarness(myHarness);
  },
});
```

`authBootstrap` is intentionally absent from this generic example. Add
`authBootstrap: "harness"` only when the harness meets the
[harness-owned auth bootstrap contract](/plugins/sdk-agent-harness/core-ownership#harness-owned-auth-bootstrap).

### Executor controller plugins

A harness can delegate self-hosted executor connection management to a separate
plugin. Register one controller with `api.registerAgentExecutorController(...)`.
The registry assigns ownership from the registering plugin's ID; the controller
does not choose another ID or register a second harness.

Declare `activation.onAgentHarnesses` with the runtime IDs that use this
controller, for example `["my-harness"]`. This manifest hint includes the plugin
in the prepared runtime registry without registering a harness. Startup
activation alone does not include the plugin in every model-selected registry.

```typescript
import type { AgentExecutorController } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-harness-runtime";

const controller: AgentExecutorController = {
  workspaceDirectory: "/srv/agent/workspace",
  async ensure(binding, context) {
    context.assertCurrent();
    await connectExecutor(binding, context.signal);
    context.assertCurrent();
  },
  async retire(binding, context) {
    context.assertCurrent();
    await disconnectExecutor(binding, context.signal);
    context.assertCurrent();
  },
};

api.registerAgentExecutorController(controller);
```

`workspaceDirectory` is an absolute path on the executor. It can differ from the
Gateway's workspace. `AgentExecutorBinding` contains `sessionKey`, `agentId`,
`nativeSessionId`, `environmentId`, `remoteUrl`, and `workspaceDirectory`.
`ensure` idempotently connects or reconnects that exact environment; `retire`
idempotently releases that environment's connection. Neither operation creates
or deletes the native agent session. The controller owns its transport,
credentials, and process management. For Agents API, each native session owns
its direct executor process; multiple sessions can share the same host and
persistent workspace. Readiness and connection requests are separate: the
harness invokes `ensure` for a current `environment_connection` action, including
while its input submission waits, rather than probing before every turn.

Harness implementations import `resolveAgentExecutorController(pluginId)` from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-harness-runtime` and resolve the explicitly configured
plugin during an admitted invocation. Resolution uses only that invocation's
registry and fails for a missing, disabled, or unavailable owner. It does not
activate plugins or fall back to a process-global registry. Handles expire when
their registry generation or owner retires or their registration is replaced;
resolve a new handle in each invocation instead of caching one across turns.

Pass an `AgentExecutorContext` with a required `signal` and `assertCurrent`.
The host combines caller cancellation with registry and plugin lifetime, checks
authority before and after each operation, and preserves the caller's scope when
the controller calls `assertCurrent`. Controller implementations must honor the
signal and recheck authority after awaits and before each side effect. The
assertion expires when the operation finishes.

The harness retains session binding persistence, native readiness checks, work
settlement before retirement, and retryable cleanup. An executor controller
does not confer permission to reset unrelated sessions or stop a shared runtime.

A harness whose `reset` cannot settle required native work throws
`AgentHarnessSessionCleanupError` from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-harness-runtime`.
The host waits for the other cleanup callbacks, then rejects the reset before
replacing the local session. Ordinary reset-hook errors remain best effort.
Reply-driven resets use the same required-cleanup check before committing their
session boundary.

### Isolated completion

The optional `runIsolatedCompletionV2(params)` capability serves product paths
that require one fresh prompt-only inference call with a literal empty
model-callable tool surface. Core passes provider and model ids, prompts,
deadline controls, and one prepared `authorization`:

- `owner: "host"` contains the exact transport `model` and resolved `auth`.
- `owner: "harness"` contains the prepared runtime auth plan and a credential
  snapshot restricted to the single profile selected for that call. Core owns
  automatic fallback order and invokes the harness separately for each candidate.

Agents API is a documented exception to the literal empty tool surface: it
creates a fresh session without an executor, supplied functions, web search,
vaults, or subagents, but the service may retain built-in helpers. This restricted
mode is enabled by default. Rejecting tool-bearing output does not prevent a
helper from acting during inference. Callers requiring a literal zero-tool
guarantee must select a runtime that provides it.

Each new isolated completion uses the configuration and agent/workspace directories
of its admitted runtime generation. Explicit model, auth-profile, and runtime
selections remain fixed while that generation is prepared. Registry preparation
selects provider and harness owners, including their declared harness dependencies.
Preparation does not add memory or context-engine plugins merely because the
agent selects them, or unrelated startup plugins, and does not adopt Gateway
agent capabilities.

Host-authorized calls must use the supplied model and credential without substitution.
Harnesses using the shared host-prepared completion helper
preserve the exact route, deadline, sampling options, and empty tool surface.
Harness-authorized calls may resolve only the supplied prepared
route and scoped profiles, or the harness's native account when the plan leaves
auth to the harness. The harness must not switch routes, reuse a native thread,
attach tools, invoke agent lifecycle hooks, or deliver output.

To report the same execution route in utility-model settings, a harness may add
`resolveIsolatedCompletionRuntime({ authorizationOwner })`, where the owner is
`"host"` or `"harness"`. Return `"openclaw"` when that authorization owner uses the
shared host-prepared completion helper,
or `"self"` when the harness executes the call. Without this hook, the settings
report the harness itself. Keep the selector synchronous and side-effect-free,
and reuse it in isolated dispatch so the reported route follows execution.

When supplied, call `params.assertCurrent()` after preparation awaits and
immediately before each credential handoff, inference request, or process start,
including retries.
It revalidates the caller's live authority and expires when the completion ends.
A thrown assertion ends execution; do not treat it as a credential failure or
retry with another profile. Continue to honor `abortSignal`; cleanup must remain
available after authority expires.

Return `{ assistant: AssistantMessage }`. Core accepts only terminal text/thinking
content with a `stop` or `length` stop reason; tool calls, failed stops, and empty
output are rejected. Title requests set `outputTextPolicy: "strict-visible"`:
keep reasoning separate without recovering ambiguous reasoning as visible text;
an empty visible result is valid. The host-prepared helper maps this policy to
strict parsing before recovery. Omission preserves ordinary recovery behavior.
CLI-backed title calls also allow clean empty output without a silent-reply token;
ordinary CLI calls still reject empty responses.
Older external harnesses may ignore the policy; a final title filter cannot
restore provenance that a harness already discarded, so this is not a universal
reasoning-privacy guarantee. Except for the documented Agents API limitation,
if the harness cannot enforce isolation, omit the capability.
Callers that require isolated completion then fail closed before invoking that
harness; OpenClaw does not replay the request through another runtime.
Plugin callers request isolated execution through
`api.runtime.llm.complete({ execution: { mode: "isolated-agent-runtime" } })`;
the harness callback is the provider-side enforcement SPI, not a second caller
API.

The legacy `runIsolatedCompletion(params)` host-auth-only capability is
deprecated and remains available for external plugins through 2026-10-12.
Implement V2 for harness-owned or native authentication; OpenClaw never invents
a host credential when only the legacy capability is present.

Native agent servers often have ambient built-in tools even when OpenClaw sends
an empty tool list. Disable and attest those native capabilities for the fresh
turn, use a separate transport that can serialize a true zero-tool request, or
leave the capability unsupported. Agents API retains the documented exception
above until its service can enforce that boundary.

Audit evidence follows the same boundary. OpenClaw can record registered plugin
ownership and run admission, but it cannot claim an external native side effect
from an ACP update or transcript. A side effect wholly inside that runtime is
`unsupported` unless an adapter invokes an OpenClaw-owned callback before the
action. Do not reconstruct the callback from native tool status events.

### Delegated execution

A harness owner may set `delegatedExecutionPluginIds` to the ids of trusted
plugins that need to execute an existing model-locked session, such as a voice
transport continuing a Codex-backed conversation. This is static owner consent,
not a core allowlist. Keep it narrow.

Delegates receive only work admission and embedded execution. OpenClaw requires
the exact stored session key, store path, and session id; `modelSelectionLocked:
true`; and matching `agentHarnessId` and `agentHarnessRuntimeOverride` values.
The run is then scoped through the harness owner. Session creation, patching,
reset, deletion, archive, and Gateway mutation remain owner-only.
