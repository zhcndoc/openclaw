Keep OpenClaw up to date.

For Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes image replacements, see
[Upgrading container images](/install/docker#upgrading-container-images). The
gateway runs startup-safe upgrade work before readiness and exits if mounted
state needs manual repair.

Before a significant update, [create a verified backup](#before-updating-create-a-verified-backup).
Automatic config copies and migration recovery originals are not a full-state
backup.

## Recommended: `openclaw update`

Detects your install type (npm, pnpm, Bun, or git), validates the candidate while
the old Gateway serves, then activates and verifies the update.

```bash
openclaw update
```

An already-installed registry package version or Git target SHA still runs plugin maintenance, repairs eligible old OpenClaw release pins, and restarts a running managed Gateway only when plugins change and `--no-restart` is not set; unchanged runs finish as `skipped` / `already-current`.

Plugin maintenance does not fail an otherwise successful core update. If a plugin
cannot be updated, OpenClaw continues with the remaining plugins, keeps the previous
installation where possible, and prints a short next action. A running updated
Gateway can also report a plugin that did not load without turning the core update
into a failure. Individual plugin outcomes remain available in `--json` output.
Failures to install core, repair required configuration or state, or start the
updated Gateway remain update failures.
An explicit package artifact (for example, a tarball path or URL) is validated
and installed even when its version matches; matching versions do not prove
that two artifacts contain the same code.
An explicit `--channel` choice still becomes the saved update channel.
For targets that support candidate validation, Doctor lint, config and plugin planning, and a
canary boot on copied state finish before the service stops. The stopped interval
contains the swap, required migrations, plugin downloads and convergence, and
service start. Plugin work uses the installed target without requiring a serving
Gateway. A changed plugin snapshot runs fresh Doctor migrations before restart;
unchanged plugins do not run another full Doctor pass. The final report records
downtime through convergence and final verification, plus verification
results. See
[Validation and activation](/cli/update#validation-and-activation) for the checks.

The canary uses a temporary loopback Gateway port and suppresses background
listeners, including the MCP Apps sandbox, browser control, and channel services.
This lets validation run while the serving Gateway keeps its configured ports.
It preserves non-secret Gateway auth settings such as `gateway.auth.rateLimit`
for policy checks, while using a temporary token and disabling Tailscale identity
authentication.
The activated Gateway retains your normal listener settings.

Package updates also check npm availability for enabled configured plugins before
stopping the serving Gateway or replacing the installed core. Registry targets
are checked early; explicit package artifacts are checked using the privately
staged package version before rehearsal, live-state preparation, or activation.
The check uses the same plugin version rules as post-update synchronization,
including release-cohort tracking, beta selection, and extended-stable targets.
A missing plugin version or registry error produces a warning naming the
affected plugin; the core update can continue. Registry-target `--dry-run`
includes those warnings. For explicit artifacts, `--dry-run` does not stage the
package and reports that plugin availability checking remains pending.
Extended-stable does not accept `--tag`. Bundled and path-installed plugins do not
require registry requests.

This metadata check does not reserve downloads. Plugin-only download, install,
or load failures remain actionable warnings after an otherwise successful core
update. The updater preserves recorded choices and retains the previous plugin
payload where possible. Follow the reported `openclaw plugins update <id>` command for a
failed install or update, or `openclaw doctor --fix` for a load problem. Invalid
configuration or state, ownership errors, and failed core startup or readiness
checks still prevent completion.

Switch channels or target a specific version:

```bash
openclaw update --channel beta
openclaw update --channel extended-stable
openclaw update --channel dev
openclaw update --dry-run   # preview without applying
```

`openclaw update` has no `--verbose` flag (the installer does). For diagnostics use
`--dry-run` to preview planned actions, `--json` for structured results, or
`openclaw update status --json` to inspect channel and availability state.

`--channel beta` selects the newest version by semantic version order from the
beta and latest npm dist-tags. Use `--tag beta` for a one-off package update pinned to the raw npm
beta dist-tag instead.

A saved `update.channel` remains the channel for future updates, automatic
checks, and update status. For example, a one-off beta package on a saved stable
channel keeps checking stable afterward. Use `--channel beta` to subscribe to
beta updates. Plugins still follow the installed core version where required
for compatibility.

`--channel extended-stable` is package-only, and installation remains
foreground-only. OpenClaw reads the public npm `extended-stable` selector,
verifies the selected exact package, and installs that exact version. Missing
or inconsistent registry data fails closed; it never falls back to `latest`.
If the selected version is older than the installed version, the normal
downgrade confirmation still applies. The CLI persists the channel after a
successful core update; a direct
`npm install -g openclaw@extended-stable --allow-scripts=openclaw` does not
update `update.channel`, but a final extended-stable package version still
checks only the verified `extended-stable` selector for update availability.
That direct command is for npm 12 or npm 11.16+. On npm 11.15 and earlier,
omit `--allow-scripts=openclaw`.
After the core swap, eligible official npm and trusted official ClawHub plugins with bare/default or
`latest` intent converge to that exact core version. Eligible older OpenClaw release
pins resume that default update policy. Explicit non-`latest` tags, independently
versioned pins, third-party plugins, custom ClawHub registries, and other sources retain
their existing behavior.
Version-bound runtime plugins converge to the base release cohort when the
core is a correction release (for example, `YYYY.M.P-2` uses plugin
`YYYY.M.P`).
Catalog installs created by current OpenClaw versions retain that default
intent. Verified OpenClaw-owned packages recorded at an exact OpenClaw release
no newer than core resume their catalog's default selector after a successful
update. This includes old automatic and manual pins. Their recorded registry
and plugin settings are preserved, and subsequent updates continue following
the selected channel. A version explicitly supplied to a plugin update command
still applies to that operation.

`--channel dev` gives a persistent moving GitHub `main` checkout for npm-owned
package installs and existing Git checkouts. Package
installs reject the `--tag main` shorthand because the workspace checkout is
not a self-contained package artifact. Use `openclaw update --channel dev` to
switch to the supported checkout and build flow. Other explicit package specs
keep their package-manager behavior.

On source installs, Doctor and plugin updates keep plugins built with the host.
A registry plugin with the same version string can target a different SDK, so
it does not replace the source build without matching SDK build evidence.
Existing registry generations remain on disk; convergence reports the bundled
selection and skips their refresh. `OPENCLAW_DEV_SOURCE_ROOT` is not required.

Managed npm plugins on the beta channel use the same newest-of-beta/latest
selection, including official plugins such as `@openclaw/codex`. An older beta
tag cannot hold a plugin behind the current stable release. Startup repair
leaves already-current packages in place so a no-op refresh does not require
another restart.

See [Release channels](/install/development-channels) for channel semantics.

### Updating from 2026.9.2 across a schema bump

Updates driven by OpenClaw 2026.9.2 can cross a shared-state schema bump normally.
The target applies the migration content while retaining the old published
schema version, so the old updater can finish its ledger writes and final
report. Doctor explains that schema content is applied and version publication
is deferred. The new Gateway runs on the migrated content during this interval.

Publication waits until every affected update run has been terminal for at least
five minutes. A running row that has not changed for more than 30 minutes counts
as abandoned for publication purposes only; this does not terminalize an
identityless update-history row. The Gateway watcher publishes after the deadline;
a later database open can also publish it. See the precise timing and residual
old-CLI limitation in [Database schemas](/reference/database-schemas#schema-bumps-and-older-updaters).

If an agent database also needs migration, required state metadata is missing,
or the state-content migration fails, Doctor instead reports
`update-schema-bump-unfenced` with database versions and manual update commands.
Let the failed update finish restoring the previous package. OpenClaw 2026.9.2
leaves the Gateway service stopped after failed post-install verification. Run
the manual update from a shell outside the Gateway, replacing `<target>` with
the exact target version from the refusal:

```bash
openclaw gateway stop
npm install -g openclaw@<target> --allow-scripts=openclaw
openclaw doctor --fix
openclaw gateway start
```

Run each command only after the previous one succeeds. On npm 11.15 and earlier,
omit `--allow-scripts=openclaw`. For a pnpm-owned install, replace the install
command with `pnpm add -g --allow-build=openclaw openclaw@<target>`; for Bun, use
`bun add -g --trust openclaw@<target>`.

Same-schema updates, earlier ledger-less updaters such as 2026.9.1, and fenced
transactional updaters from 2026.9.3 onward keep their existing behavior. The
fallback does not undo an earlier migration; if the database is already newer
than the restored package, install a compatible target and finish Doctor before
starting the Gateway.

### From chat

Ask the agent to update OpenClaw, or send `/update` from Discord or another
connected chat. Natural-language requests use the existing `gateway` tool's
`update.run` action. The minimal, coding, and messaging profiles expose that update
action without granting configuration reads or other Gateway controls. Explicit tool
restrictions still apply.

`/update` is the model-independent fallback: it works without a functioning model
or access to the `gateway` tool. The tool, slash command, and Control UI all use
the same Gateway update handler and current authorization checks.

The candidate validates while the old Gateway serves, and an already-current
update restarts it only when plugins change. Update runs can send these notices
in that chat as the Gateway observes the recorded milestones:

1. An acknowledgement when the update is accepted.
2. `⏳ Restarting the gateway now (v<from> → v<to>)…` when activation is recorded before the Gateway stops.
3. `🔁 Back on v<to>, verifying…` when the new Gateway starts verification.
4. The final report, including successful updates.

External update and restart notices go only to destinations listed in
`commands.ownerAllowFrom`. Selecting a non-owner chat in the Control UI does not
authorize notices to that contact. If no owner destination resolves, OpenClaw
logs the skipped notice and keeps the update outcome in the run record and
Control UI; it does not redirect the notice to another chat or wake the rejected
session with diagnostics.

Update lifecycle notices also honor the destination account's `actions.sendMessage`
policy. An explicit account setting overrides the channel default; when neither
sets the flag, notices are allowed. Disabled sends are recorded as skipped notices
without preventing the update or its Control UI report.

Managed systemd or launchd updates can stop the Gateway before an intermediate
notice is delivered. The complete four-message sequence is not guaranteed for
those installations; the durable run report remains available after reconnect.

Runs with an internal origin session, including Control UI and webchat, receive
these notices directly in that session's transcript. Passing only `sessionKey`
is enough; the caller does not need to supply `deliveryContext`.
Before stopping the managed service, the updater waits for the serving Gateway
to finish its restart notice attempt. That wait is capped at 10 seconds so a
stalled notice cannot block activation.

The report includes the outcome, recorded phase durations, failed steps,
verification facts, and the next action when needed. A run sends each notice
at most once; an update that stops before restart sends only the notices for
phases it reached. If the update cannot start, the bot records and explains why
and provides the manual command when available.
The agent relays the returned recovery instructions to the operator. Manual
update commands run in a terminal outside the Gateway service; the agent must
not execute them in the shell of the Gateway hosting its session. A missing
owner permission requires owner setup, and an externally supervised installation
uses its deployment owner's update workflow.

Chat, CLI, Control UI, and automatic updates share a durable run ID. Use
`openclaw update status` to read the active or latest report, including after a
restart; `--json` exposes the `activeRun` and `lastRun` records. See
[Run history and reports](/cli/update#run-history-and-reports) for Gateway history
queries.

The sender must be in [`commands.ownerAllowFrom`](/tools/slash-commands#configuration).
Being allowed to chat does not grant owner permissions. If your account is not
an owner, the reply explains how the Gateway operator can connect it. Channel
setup and [pairing](/channels/pairing) distinguish owner access from chat access;
existing allowed users are not automatically promoted.
External-chat updates through `/update` or the tool require `commands.restart`
(enabled by default), including managed installations. The slash command also
follows command-access restrictions; tool calls follow tool policy. Chat updates use the hosting installation's
configured update channel and install method.
Agents must never run `npm install -g openclaw` or stop the Gateway service
from a chat shell; use `/update` or the update action so restart and notification
stay coordinated.

## Stale update history

Untouched, identityless legacy admissions older than 24 hours can
[expire automatically](/cli/update/status-and-history#run-history-and-reports)
during Gateway startup or a status check. The row is retained as `failed` with
reason `legacy-driver-expired` and retry advice; no explicit repair is needed
for that shape.

If update status stays in progress while the Gateway is healthy, check that no
update is still running. On the updated installation, run:

```bash
openclaw update repair
openclaw update status
```

For an inactive legacy row older than 30 minutes, repair verifies that the
running Gateway matches the installed version and build, then clears the stale
run without maintenance or a service restart. A new explicit `openclaw update`
can also supersede a single stale identityless row. Recent rows and recorded
live drivers are protected. Identityless rows outside the legacy-expiry shape
require explicit recovery; the Control UI's configuration-write suspension clears
after reconciliation.

OpenClaw 2026.9.2 does not reject a new CLI update because an older running row
exists: its [admission path](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/v2026.9.2/src/cli/update-cli/update-command-run.ts#L77)
creates a new run, and its [ledger](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/v2026.9.2/src/infra/update-run-ledger.ts#L250)
checks only for a duplicate run ID. Upgrade normally, then use the updated
`openclaw update repair` if the old history remains. A package-manager escape
is not required for this ledger defect. See [Update run history](/cli/update#run-history-and-reports).

## Retire update recovery data

Once you have verified the update and your conversations, preview retained
migration originals:

```bash
openclaw update cleanup --dry-run
```

Use the same profile and state/config overrides as the update, and check the
state directory printed in the report. The metadata-only preview can run while
the Gateway is active. To apply, stop that Gateway yourself, wait for other
SQLite maintenance to finish, and stop database readers such as session-listing
watchers. Keep them stopped until `openclaw update cleanup` exits; read-only
connections can change WAL/SHM sidecars and invalidate verification. Cleanup never
stops or restarts the Gateway. Confirmation defaults to **No**; automation must
explicitly pass `--yes`, including when using `--json`.

Cleanup permanently gives up rollback to eligible originals, including repaired
branches and old provider metadata. Current SQLite history, operator backups,
and protected or unknown artifacts remain. It is not a substitute for a
[pre-update backup](#before-updating-create-a-verified-backup). See
[Update cleanup](/cli/update#update-cleanup) for eligibility, JSON output, and
resuming interrupted deletion.
Private package, command-shim, and Git runtime backups remain owned by the update
transaction and are outside this migration cleanup. An interrupted entry in update
history does not block cleanup of otherwise eligible migration archives.

## After updating

Successful managed `openclaw update` runs already restart and verify the Gateway.
Use these steps after a manual installation or when checking a reported problem.

<Steps>

### Run doctor

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

Migrates config, audits DM policies, and checks gateway health. Doctor also compares active official plugins with the OpenClaw package the managed service will load after restart. Resolve any plugin restart-readiness warning before continuing. Details: [Doctor](/gateway/doctor)

If you use the unpacked Chrome extension, also run `openclaw browser doctor --browser-profile chrome`.
For a version-mismatch warning, reload the extension from `chrome://extensions`;
fully restart Chrome if the warning remains.

### Restart the gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Verify

```bash
openclaw health
```
