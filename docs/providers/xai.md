title: "xAI"
---

OpenClaw ships a bundled `xai` provider plugin for Grok models. The
recommended path is Grok OAuth with an eligible SuperGrok or X Premium
subscription. Gateway, config, routing, and tools stay local; only Grok
requests go to xAI's API.

OAuth does not require an xAI API key or the Grok Build app. xAI may still
show Grok Build on the consent screen because OpenClaw uses xAI's shared
OAuth client.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="New install">
    Run onboarding with daemon install, then pick xAI/Grok OAuth at the
    model/auth step:

    ```bash
    openclaw onboard --install-daemon
    ```

    On a VPS or over SSH, select xAI OAuth directly; it uses device-code
    verification and does not need a localhost callback:

    ```bash
    openclaw onboard --install-daemon --auth-choice xai-oauth
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Existing install">
    Sign in to xAI only; do not rerun full onboarding just to connect Grok:

    ```bash
    openclaw models auth login --provider xai --method oauth
    ```

    With no existing primary model, OAuth setup selects the curated default,
    `xai/grok-4.6`. Authenticated discovery updates available model rows without
    changing that default.
    It preserves an existing primary; opt in explicitly when needed:

    ```bash
    openclaw models set xai/grok-4.6
    ```

    Rerun full onboarding only if you intentionally want to change Gateway,
    daemon, channel, workspace, or other setup choices.

  </Step>
  <Step title="API-key path">
    API-key setup still works for xAI Console keys and for media surfaces
    that need key-backed provider config. It uses the same Grok 4.6 setup default:

    ```bash
    openclaw models auth login --provider xai --method api-key
    export XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick a model">
    ```json5
    {
      agents: { defaults: { model: { primary: "xai/grok-4.6" } } },
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
OpenClaw uses the xAI Responses API as the bundled xAI transport. The same
credential from `openclaw models auth login --provider xai --method oauth` or
`--method api-key` also powers `web_search` (provider id `grok`), `x_search`,
`code_execution`, speech/transcription, and xAI image/video generation. If you
store an xAI key under `plugins.entries.xai.config.webSearch.apiKey`, the
bundled xAI model provider reuses it as a fallback too.
</Note>

`openclaw status --usage`, `/status`, and the Control UI usage cards show
SuperGrok quota when the xAI provider is signed in with OAuth. OpenClaw fetches
the Grok billing window for that subscription and reports its reset time through
the normal provider-usage surface. API-key-only xAI setups are intentionally not
shown as SuperGrok usage because xAI Console API credits and SuperGrok
subscription quota are separate billing buckets.

## OAuth troubleshooting

- For SSH, Docker, VPS, or other remote setups, use
  `openclaw models auth login --provider xai --method oauth`; it uses
  device-code verification, not a localhost callback.
- If a previous OAuth login left xAI using the API-key endpoint or catalog,
  rerun `openclaw models auth login --provider xai --method oauth`. A successful
  login refreshes the subscription catalog and proxy route from your account.
  It preserves your primary model and fallbacks.
- If sign-in succeeds but Grok is not the default model, run
  `openclaw models set xai/grok-4.6`. OAuth login preserves an existing
  primary model unless you explicitly change it.
- Inspect saved xAI auth profiles:

  ```bash
  openclaw models auth list --provider xai
  openclaw models status
  ```

- xAI decides which accounts can receive OAuth API tokens. If an account is
  not eligible, use the API-key path or check the subscription on xAI's side.

Existing `xai/auto` selections on the Grok subscription route are retired.
Run `openclaw doctor --fix` to replace affected config and session selections
with `xai/grok-4.6`. Doctor preserves account pins and fallbacks, and leaves
custom endpoints unchanged. For a pinned session, an unavailable account or a
disallowed successor keeps the selection unchanged, with a diagnostic explaining
the required action. Unpinned config can be repaired from its declared
subscription route. You can also choose a permitted concrete model explicitly.

For a manually managed Grok subscription token, set `models.providers.xai.auth`
to `"token"` and `models.providers.xai.baseUrl` to
`https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1`. Model discovery uses the subscription
catalog and keeps token authentication; an unavailable token does not switch
discovery to the Console API. Tokens with the default or native xAI API endpoint
continue to use the API catalog. Prefer OAuth login for automatic token refresh.
Resolved environment-backed tokens also work in standalone model commands without
a running Gateway.

<Tip>
Use `xai-oauth` when signing in from SSH, Docker, or a VPS. OpenClaw prints a
URL and short code; finish sign-in in any local browser while the remote
process polls xAI for the completed token exchange.
</Tip>

## Built-in catalog

Selectable ids in model pickers. The plugin still resolves older Grok 3,
Grok 4, Grok 4 Fast, Grok 4.1 Fast, and Grok Code ids for existing configs;
see [legacy compatibility and moving aliases](#legacy-compatibility-and-moving-aliases).

| Family         | Model ids                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Grok 4.6       | `grok-4.6`                                                   |
| Grok 4.5       | `grok-4.5` (aliases: `grok-4.5-latest`, `grok-build-latest`) |
| Grok Build 0.1 | `grok-build-0.1`                                             |
| Grok 4.3       | `grok-4.3` (aliases: `grok-4.3-latest`, `grok-latest`)       |
| Grok 4.20      | `grok-4.20-0309-reasoning`, `grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning`   |

<Tip>
OAuth and API-key setup use `xai/grok-4.6` as the curated default.
Grok 4.5, `grok-build-0.1`, Grok 4.3, and both dated
Grok 4.20 variants remain selectable.
</Tip>

The plugin manifest owns the curated list. Ordinary API-key setup keeps that
inventory in the plugin instead of copying it into your configuration;
`models.mode: "replace"` still receives the curated rows. Explicit model rows
remain unchanged. OAuth login retains its authenticated account catalog.

Catalog context and token-cost metadata follows xAI's live
[model pages](https://docs.x.ai/developers/models) and
[pricing page](https://docs.x.ai/developers/pricing). xAI applies higher rates
when a request crosses its documented 200k-token long-context threshold:
for Grok 4.5 and Grok 4.6, input, cached-input, and output rates double.
OpenClaw's flat catalog cost fields record the short-context rates. The current
[Grok Build](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview) coding agent uses Grok 4.6. The
historical OpenClaw `grok-build-latest` compatibility alias remains pinned to
Grok 4.5.

Supported non-curated aliases retain their reasoning, input, and token-limit
metadata without joining the published inventory. Their pricing remains unknown,
recorded as zero until the manifest includes them. Zero is an unavailable estimate, not a claim that
the provider charges nothing.

## Feature coverage

The bundled plugin maps supported xAI APIs onto OpenClaw's shared provider and
tool contracts. Capabilities that do not fit the shared contract are listed
below or under known limits.

| xAI capability             | OpenClaw surface                        | Status                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Chat / Responses           | `xai/<model>` model provider            | Yes                                                  |
| Context compaction         | `/compact` and threshold compaction     | Yes via `/v1/responses/compact`                      |
| Server-side web search     | `web_search` provider `grok`            | Yes                                                  |
| Server-side X search       | `x_search` tool                         | Yes                                                  |
| Server-side code execution | `code_execution` tool                   | Yes                                                  |
| Images                     | `image_generate`                        | Yes                                                  |
| Videos                     | `video_generate`                        | Yes                                                  |
| Batch text-to-speech       | `tts.provider: "xai"` / `tts`           | Yes                                                  |
| Streaming TTS              | `textToSpeechStream`                    | Yes via `wss://api.x.ai/v1/tts` (not realtime voice) |
| Batch speech-to-text       | `tools.media.audio` media understanding | Yes                                                  |
| Streaming speech-to-text   | Voice Call `streaming.provider: "xai"`  | Yes                                                  |
| Realtime voice             | Talk `talk.realtime.provider: "xai"`    | Yes; gateway-relay for native Talk nodes             |
| Files / batches            | Generic model API compatibility only    | Not a first-class OpenClaw tool                      |

<Note>
OpenClaw uses xAI's REST image/video/TTS/STT APIs for media generation and
batch transcription, xAI's streaming STT WebSocket for live voice-call
transcription, xAI's Grok Voice Agent WebSocket for Talk realtime sessions,
and the Responses API for chat, search, and code-execution tools.
</Note>

### Legacy fast-mode compatibility

`/fast on` or `agents.defaults.models["xai/<model>"].params.fastMode: true`
still rewrites older xAI configurations as follows. These target ids are
kept only for compatibility; use current selectable models for new
configurations.

| Source model  | Fast-mode target   |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| `grok-3`      | `grok-3-fast`      |
| `grok-3-mini` | `grok-3-mini-fast` |
| `grok-4`      | `grok-4-fast`      |
| `grok-4-0709` | `grok-4-fast`      |

### Legacy compatibility and moving aliases

Older aliases normalize as follows:

| Legacy alias                                                  | Normalized id    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `grok-code-fast-1`, `grok-code-fast`, `grok-code-fast-1-0825` | `grok-build-0.1` |

The dated 0309 ids are the selectable catalog entries. OpenClaw sends all other
current Grok 4.20 aliases verbatim so xAI retains control of stable, latest,
beta, experimental, and dated alias semantics. The global `grok-latest` alias is
also preserved verbatim.

xAI retired the following exact ids. Existing configurations keep their
normalization and transport paths; uncurated model names use unknown pricing:

| Retired ids                                                          | Current behavior                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning`, `grok-4-fast-reasoning`, `grok-4-0709`    | Grok 4.3 with `low` reasoning    |
| `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning`, `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning`, `grok-3` | Grok 4.3 with reasoning disabled |
| `grok-code-fast-1`                                                   | Grok Build 0.1                   |
| `grok-imagine-image-pro`                                             | Grok Imagine Image Quality       |

`openclaw doctor --fix` updates persisted xAI server-tool defaults and the
retired quality image slug, removes stale generated catalog rows, and repairs
stale context metadata on active 4.20 rows. It does not pin active 4.20
`beta-latest` aliases to a dated snapshot.

## Features

Unconfigured `web_search`, `x_search`, and `code_execution` requests use Grok 4.6.
This also applies to existing installations that omit the tool model setting.
An explicit tool model remains selected; the Grok 4.3 examples below are overrides.

<Warning>
  `x_search` and `code_execution` run on xAI's servers. xAI bills $5 per 1,000
  tool calls, plus the model's input and output tokens. With each tool's
  `enabled` setting omitted, OpenClaw exposes it only for an active xAI model.
  A known non-xAI model provider requires an explicit per-tool `enabled: true`;
  a missing or unresolved provider fails closed. xAI auth is always required,
  and `enabled: false` disables the tool for every provider.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Web search">
    The bundled `grok` web-search provider prefers xAI OAuth, then falls back
    to `XAI_API_KEY` or a plugin web-search key:

    ```bash
    openclaw models auth login --provider xai --method oauth
    openclaw config set tools.web.search.provider grok
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Video generation">
    The bundled `xai` plugin registers video generation through the shared
    `video_generate` tool.

    - Default model: `xai/grok-imagine-video`
    - Additional model: `xai/grok-imagine-video-1.5`
    - Classic modes: text-to-video, image-to-video, reference-image generation,
      remote video edit, and remote video extension
    - Video 1.5 mode: image-to-video only, with exactly one first-frame image
    - Aspect ratios: `1:1`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `3:2`, `2:3`;
      classic and Video 1.5 image-to-video inherit the source image ratio when
      omitted
    - Resolutions: classic `480P`/`720P`; Video 1.5 also supports `1080P`; all
      generation modes default to `480P`
    - Duration: 1-15 seconds for generation/image-to-video, 1-10 seconds when
      using classic `reference_image` roles, 2-10 seconds for classic extension
    - Reference-image generation: set `imageRoles` to `reference_image` for
      every supplied image; xAI accepts up to 7 such images
    - Video edit/extend inherit the input video's aspect ratio and resolution;
      those operations do not accept geometry overrides
    - Default operation timeout: 600 seconds unless `video_generate.timeoutMs`
      or `agents.defaults.mediaModels.video.timeoutMs` is set

    <Warning>
    Local video buffers are not accepted. Use remote `http(s)` URLs for video
    edit/extend inputs. Image-to-video accepts local image buffers because
    OpenClaw encodes those as data URLs for xAI.
    </Warning>

    Video 1.5 also recognizes xAI's `grok-imagine-video-1.5-preview` and
    `grok-imagine-video-1.5-2026-05-30` identifiers. OpenClaw forwards the
    selected identifier unchanged, but applies the same image-only validation.

    To use xAI as the default video provider:

    ```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          mediaModels: {
            video: {
              primary: "xai/grok-imagine-video",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    <Note>
    See [Video Generation](/tools/video-generation) for shared tool
    parameters, provider selection, and failover behavior.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Image generation">
    The bundled `xai` plugin registers image generation through the shared
    `image_generate` tool.

    - Default image model: `xai/grok-imagine-image`
    - Additional model: `xai/grok-imagine-image-quality`
    - Modes: text-to-image and reference-image edit
    - Reference inputs: one `image` or up to three `images`
    - Aspect ratios: `1:1`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `3:2`, `2:3`, `2:1`,
      `1:2`, `19.5:9`, `9:19.5`, `20:9`, `9:20`
    - Resolutions: `1K`, `2K`
    - Count: up to 4 images
    - Default operation timeout: 600 seconds unless `image_generate.timeoutMs`
      or `agents.defaults.mediaModels.image.timeoutMs` is set

    OpenClaw asks xAI for `b64_json` image responses so generated media can be
    stored and delivered through the normal channel attachment path. Local
    reference images are converted to data URLs; remote `http(s)` references
    pass through unchanged.

    To use xAI as the default image provider:

    ```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          mediaModels: {
            image: {
              primary: "xai/grok-imagine-image",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    <Note>
    xAI also documents `quality`, `mask`, `user`, and an `auto` aspect ratio.
    OpenClaw forwards only the shared cross-provider image controls today;
    these native-only knobs are not exposed through `image_generate`.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Text-to-speech">
    The bundled `xai` plugin registers text-to-speech through the shared `tts`
    provider surface.

    - Voices: authenticated live catalog from xAI; list it with
      `openclaw infer tts voices --provider xai`
    - Offline fallback voices: `ara`, `eve`, `leo`, `rex`, `sal`
    - Default voice: `eve`
    - Account custom voice IDs are forwarded even when they are absent from the
      built-in catalog response
    - Formats: `mp3`, `wav`, `pcm`, `mulaw`, `alaw`
    - Language: BCP-47 code or `auto`
    - Speed: provider-native speed override
    - Native Opus voice-note format is not supported

    To use xAI as the default TTS provider:

    ```json5
    {
      tts: {
        provider: "xai",
        providers: {
          xai: {
            voiceId: "eve",
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    <Note>
    OpenClaw uses xAI's batch `/v1/tts` endpoint for buffered synthesis,
    authenticated `/v1/tts/voices` catalog discovery, and native
    `wss://api.x.ai/v1/tts` for streaming synthesis. Streaming is restricted to
    the native `api.x.ai` host, so custom `baseUrl` values are rejected on this
    path. It uses the existing language, voice, codec, and speed controls; xAI
    defaults apply to sample rate and bit rate. Audio-file synthesis honors all
    configured codecs. Voice-note targets use MP3 for streaming and buffered
    fallback because xAI's raw codecs do not carry codec/rate metadata. The
    stream sends `text.delta` then
    `text.done`, receives `audio.delta`, `audio.done`, or `error`, and applies an
    idle `timeoutMs` that refreshes for every audio chunk. It is separate from
    realtime voice sessions. See xAI's [Streaming TTS API](https://docs.x.ai/developers/rest-api-reference/inference/voice) contract.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Speech-to-text">
    The bundled `xai` plugin registers batch speech-to-text through OpenClaw's
    media-understanding transcription surface.

    - Endpoint: xAI REST `/v1/stt`
    - Input path: multipart audio file upload
    - Model selection: xAI chooses the transcription model internally; the
      endpoint has no model selector
    - Used wherever inbound audio transcription reads `tools.media.audio`,
      including Discord voice-channel segments and channel audio attachments

    To force xAI for inbound audio transcription:

    ```json5
    {
      tools: {
        media: {
          models: [
            {
              type: "provider",
              provider: "xai",
              capabilities: ["audio"],
            },
          ],
          audio: {
            enabled: true,
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    Language can be supplied through the shared audio media config or per-call
    transcription request. Prompt hints are accepted by the shared OpenClaw
    surface, but the xAI REST STT integration forwards only file and language
    because those map to the current public xAI endpoint.

    Valid empty transcripts are skipped, and OpenClaw tries any configured
    fallback. Malformed responses and HTTP failures remain errors.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Streaming speech-to-text">
    The bundled `xai` plugin also registers a realtime transcription provider
    for live voice-call audio.

    - Endpoint: xAI WebSocket `wss://api.x.ai/v1/stt`
    - Default encoding: `mulaw`
    - Default sample rate: `8000`
    - Default endpointing: `800ms`
    - Interim transcripts: enabled by default

    Voice Call's Twilio media stream sends G.711 mu-law audio frames, so the
    xAI provider forwards those frames directly without transcoding:

    ```json5
    {
      plugins: {
        entries: {
          "voice-call": {
            config: {
              streaming: {
                enabled: true,
                provider: "xai",
                providers: {
                  xai: {
                    apiKey: "${XAI_API_KEY}",
                    endpointingMs: 800,
                    language: "en",
                  },
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    Provider-owned config lives under
    `plugins.entries.voice-call.config.streaming.providers.xai`. Supported
    keys are `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, `sampleRate`, `encoding` (`pcm`, `mulaw`, or
    `alaw`), `interimResults`, `endpointingMs`, and `language`.

    <Note>
    This streaming provider is for Voice Call's realtime transcription path.
    Discord voice records short segments and uses the batch
    `tools.media.audio` transcription path instead.

    The bundled `xai` plugin registers Grok Voice Agent realtime sessions for
    Talk mode through the shared `registerRealtimeVoiceProvider` contract.

    - Endpoint: `wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime?model=<voice-model>`
    - Default model: `grok-voice-latest`
    - Default voice: `eve`
    - Transport: `gateway-relay` (iOS, Android, and Control UI relay paths)
    - Audio: PCM16 24 kHz or G.711 µ-law 8 kHz
    - Barge-in: xAI server VAD interrupts the response; OpenClaw clears queued playback
      and truncates unplayed provider history

    Configure Talk on the Gateway:

    ```json5
    {
      talk: {
        realtime: {
          provider: "xai",
          mode: "realtime",
          transport: "gateway-relay",
          brain: "agent-consult",
          providers: {
            xai: {
              model: "grok-voice-latest",
              voice: "eve",
              // Opt in only if provider-side session replay is acceptable.
              sessionResumption: false,
            },
          },
        },
      },
      env: { vars: { XAI_API_KEY: "xai-..." } },
    }
    ```

    Provider-owned config also resolves from
    `plugins.entries.voice-call.config.realtime.providers.xai` when Voice Call
    or shared realtime selectors reuse the same provider map. Supported keys are
    `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, `model`, `voice`, `vadThreshold`, `silenceDurationMs`,
    `prefixPaddingMs`, `reasoningEffort`, and `sessionResumption`.
    `reasoningEffort` accepts only `high` or `none`, matching the xAI Voice Agent API.

    xAI's server VAD always creates responses and handles audio interruption.
    Use `consultRouting: "provider-direct"`; forced transcript routing and disabling
    input-audio interruption are not supported by the xAI Voice Agent protocol.

    <Note>
    xAI OAuth or `XAI_API_KEY` can authenticate realtime voice. Browser-owned
    WebRTC is not part of this provider surface yet; use gateway-relay Talk on
    native nodes or the Control UI relay path.
    </Note>

    <Note>
    `sessionResumption` defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, OpenClaw asks
    xAI to retain enough session state to resume the same conversation after a
    reconnect and then reconnects with the returned conversation id. Leave it
    disabled when provider-side replay/retention is not acceptable; interrupted
    sockets then fail closed instead of silently starting a fresh conversation.
    </Note>

  <Accordion title="x_search configuration">
    The bundled xAI plugin exposes `x_search` as an OpenClaw tool for
    searching X (formerly Twitter) content via Grok.

    Config path: `plugins.entries.xai.config.xSearch`

    | Key               | Type    | Default                   | Description                                      |

  <Accordion title="Code execution configuration">
    The bundled xAI plugin exposes `code_execution` as an OpenClaw tool for
    remote code execution in xAI's sandbox environment.

    Config path: `plugins.entries.xai.config.codeExecution`

    | Key              | Type    | Default                  | Description                                      |
    | ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | `enabled`        | boolean | Automatic for xAI models | Disable, or opt in for a known non-xAI provider |

    <Note>
    This is remote xAI sandbox execution, not local [`exec`](/tools/exec).
    </Note>

    ```json5
    {
      plugins: {
        entries: {
          xai: {
            config: {
              codeExecution: {
                enabled: true,
                model: "grok-4.3",
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context compaction">
    Native `api.x.ai` Responses routes use xAI's server-side
    [`/responses/compact`](https://docs.x.ai/developers/advanced-api-usage/context-compaction)
    endpoint by default for manual `/compact` and threshold-driven preflight
    compaction. The session keeps its OpenClaw transcript unchanged and stores
    xAI's opaque checkpoint for the next request. Completion notices report
    the provider's before and after token counts.

    Disable the endpoint for one model with:

    ```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          models: {
            "xai/grok-4.5": {
              params: { responsesCompactEndpoint: false },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    Other Responses-compatible providers can opt in with
    `params.responsesCompactEndpoint: true`; non-Responses routes ignore the
    setting. OpenAI's native Responses API does not need this option because
    its `context_management` compaction is already managed by
    `responsesServerCompaction`.

    Endpoint failures fall back to OpenClaw's client-side summarization.
    Overflow recovery never calls the endpoint because xAI requires the input
    to fit the model context window before compaction.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Known limits">
    - xAI auth can use an API key, environment variable, plugin config
      fallback, or OAuth with an eligible xAI account. OAuth uses device-code
      verification without a localhost callback. xAI decides which accounts
      can receive OAuth API tokens, and the consent page may show Grok Build
      even though OpenClaw does not require the Grok Build app.
    - OpenClaw does not currently expose the xAI multi-agent model family. xAI
      serves these models through the Responses API, but they do not accept
      the client-side or custom tools used by OpenClaw's shared agent loop.
      See the
      [xAI multi-agent limitations](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/text/multi-agent#limitations).
    - xAI Realtime voice currently exposes gateway-relay Talk transport only.
      Browser-owned provider WebSocket sessions are not wired in the Control UI
      yet.
    - xAI image `quality`, image `mask`, and extra native-only aspect ratios are
      not exposed until the shared `image_generate` tool has corresponding
      cross-provider controls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced notes">
    - OpenClaw applies xAI-specific tool-schema and tool-call compatibility
      fixes automatically on the shared runner path.
    - Native `https://api.x.ai/v1` Responses requests keep tool images attached
      to their tool results. On compatibility routes (including Grok OAuth),
      image-capable models receive a labeled user image message immediately
      after each consecutive tool-result group. Parallel results stay together,
      and later turns preserve the historical image position for prompt caching.
      Compaction establishes a new history prefix and result numbering.
    - Native xAI requests default `tool_stream: true`. Set
      `agents.defaults.models["xai/<model>"].params.tool_stream` to `false`
      to disable it.
    - The bundled xAI wrapper strips unsupported contains-count schema bounds
      and unsupported reasoning *effort* payload keys before sending native
      xAI requests. Grok 4.6 supports low, medium, high, and xhigh effort
      (default high). Grok 4.5 supports low, medium, and high effort
      (default high). Grok 4.3 supports none, low, medium, and high
      effort (default low). Other reasoning-capable xAI models do not expose a
      configurable effort control, but still request
      `include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` so prior encrypted reasoning
      can be replayed on follow-up turns.
    - `web_search`, `x_search`, and `code_execution` are exposed as OpenClaw
      tools. OpenClaw attaches only the specific xAI built-in each tool needs
      to that tool's request instead of attaching every native tool to every
      chat turn.
    - Grok `web_search` reads `plugins.entries.xai.config.webSearch.baseUrl`.
      `x_search` reads `plugins.entries.xai.config.xSearch.baseUrl`, then
      falls back to the Grok web-search base URL.
    - `x_search` and `code_execution` are owned by the bundled xAI plugin
      rather than hardcoded into the core model runtime.
    - `code_execution` is remote xAI sandbox execution, not local
      [`exec`](/tools/exec).

## Live testing

The xAI media paths are covered by unit tests and opt-in live suites. Export
`XAI_API_KEY` in the process environment before running live probes.

```bash
pnpm test extensions/xai
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST_QUIET=1 pnpm test:live -- extensions/xai/xai.live.test.ts
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 OPENCLAW_LIVE_XAI_VIDEO=1 pnpm test:live -- extensions/xai/xai.live.test.ts -t "classic Grok Imagine"
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 OPENCLAW_LIVE_XAI_VIDEO=1 pnpm test:live -- extensions/xai/xai.live.test.ts -t "Grok Imagine Video 1.5"
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST_QUIET=1 pnpm test:live -- extensions/xai/x-search.live.test.ts
OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS="xai/grok-4.6,xai/grok-4.5,xai/grok-build-0.1,xai/grok-4.3,xai/grok-4.20-0309-reasoning,xai/grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning" OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MAX_MODELS=0 OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_SMOKE=0 pnpm test:live -- src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts
OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST_QUIET=1 OPENCLAW_LIVE_IMAGE_GENERATION_PROVIDERS=xai pnpm test:live -- test/image-generation.runtime.live.test.ts
```

The provider-specific live file synthesizes normal TTS, telephony-friendly PCM
TTS, transcribes audio through xAI batch STT, streams the same PCM through xAI
realtime STT, generates text-to-image output, and edits a reference image.
The shared image live file verifies the same xAI provider through OpenClaw's
runtime selection, fallback, normalization, and media attachment path. The
opt-in Video 1.5 case submits one generated first-frame image at 1080P and
verifies the completed video download.
