summary: "Run OpenClaw with llmman (local models, hosted providers, and hybrid local + hosted routing)"
read_when:
  - You want to run OpenClaw against local GGUF or safetensors models through llmman
  - You want hybrid inference that keeps small requests local and overflows large ones to a hosted model
  - You need llmman setup, configuration, vision, or troubleshooting guidance
title: "llmman"
---

[llmman](https://github.com/llmmanorg/llmman) pulls models as OCI artifacts from
any registry or Hugging Face and serves them through unmodified upstream
engines: `llama-server` for GGUF, `vllm` or `mlx-lm` for safetensors. One
daemon exposes Ollama-, OpenAI-, and Anthropic-compatible APIs and can also
forward requests to hosted providers. OpenClaw talks to it through the generic
`openai-completions` adapter on `/v1`.

Three modes are supported:

| Mode              | What it uses                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local only        | `llmman serve` on the Gateway host or LAN, serving pulled models such as `qwen3.8`                               |
| Hybrid            | One `llmman.hybrid/<local>,<provider>/<model>` ref; llmman picks the local or hosted side per request            |
| Hosted via llmman | `llmman.provider/<provider>/<model>` refs; llmman forwards to a hosted provider while keeping one local endpoint |

| Property         | Value                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider id      | `llmman` (custom; configure under `models.providers.llmman`)                             |
| Plugin           | none; not a bundled OpenClaw provider plugin, so models are listed explicitly            |
| API              | OpenAI-compatible (`api: "openai-completions"`)                                          |
| Default base URL | `http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1`                                                              |
| Auth             | llmman has no authentication; OpenClaw sends whatever `apiKey` you configure as a bearer |
| Reference model  | `qwen3.8` (Qwen3.8 27B, vision-capable, 262,144-token native context)                    |

<Warning>
`llmman serve` has no authentication and no TLS. Keep the default loopback bind unless a trusted network boundary restricts access, and never expose it on a public interface.

<Info>
Version scope: this page is verified against [llmman v0.1.334](https://github.com/llmmanorg/llmman/releases/tag/v0.1.334), commit [`22b6d73`](https://github.com/llmmanorg/llmman/commit/22b6d7330e1b0882401e83e35fe592817eb7c816). Model names, hybrid routing, vision, and tool calling on this page were exercised against that build with `qwen3.8`.

## Auth rules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local llmman has no auth">
    `llmman serve` never checks credentials. OpenClaw still needs a non-empty `apiKey` on the provider entry so the provider counts as configured. This page uses `LLMMAN_API_KEY=llmman-local` with `apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}"`, mirroring the `OLLAMA_API_KEY=ollama-local` convention. A literal `apiKey: "llmman-local"` works too.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The bearer matters for hybrid and hosted refs">
    For `llmman.hybrid/...` and `llmman.provider/...` refs, llmman forwards the bearer OpenClaw presents to the hosted provider as that provider's API key. The one exception is the literal placeholder `llmman`, which tells the daemon to use its own key. See [Hybrid inference](#hybrid-inference) for both patterns. A marker such as `llmman-local` would be sent to the hosted provider and rejected there.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remote llmman hosts">
    A daemon started with `LLMMAN_HOST=0.0.0.0` in its environment binds every interface with no auth. Point OpenClaw at a LAN host only inside a network you trust; there is no credential OpenClaw can send that llmman would enforce. A daemon reachable off loopback also refuses to spend its own hosted-provider key for callers that presented none.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Env var substitution">
    `${LLMMAN_API_KEY}` resolves from the Gateway process environment or `~/.openclaw/.env`. If the variable is missing, OpenClaw logs a config warning and treats the provider as unavailable, so put the export where the Gateway can read it. See [Environment](/help/environment).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install llmman">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://llmmanorg.github.io/install.sh | sh   # Linux, macOS
    brew install llmmanorg/tap/llmman                         # Homebrew
    ```

    Windows: `irm https://llmmanorg.github.io/install.ps1 | iex` or `winget install llmmanorg.llmman`. Other options: `cargo binstall llmman`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Pull a model and start the server">
    ```bash
    llmman pull qwen3.8
    llmman serve
    ```

    Bare names such as `qwen3.8` resolve to Docker Hub's curated `docker.io/ai/<name>:latest`. `owner/repo` names resolve to `hf.co/owner/repo`; a full reference (`ghcr.io/...`, `hf.co/...`) is used as-is.

    `llmman serve` requires no arguments (an optional model argument preloads that model): it listens on `127.0.0.1:17434` and loads any pulled model on the first request that names it, then unloads it after five idle minutes. GPU acceleration (CUDA, ROCm, Vulkan, Metal) is auto-detected and the matching `llama-server` is downloaded if none is on `PATH`. Everything else is tuned through the daemon's environment: `LLMMAN_HOST` for the bind address, `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH` for the server context, `LLMMAN_KEEP_ALIVE` for the idle unload timer (see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration)).

    By default llmman uses up to 262,144 tokens, capped to the model's trained context (262,144 for `qwen3.8`) and, on out-of-memory, retries with the context halved down to a 16,384 floor. `llmman ps` shows the context a loaded model actually got; keep the OpenClaw model's `contextWindow` at or below that value.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the server">
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:17434/api/version
    curl http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1/models
    llmman ps
    ```

    There is no `/health` route; use `/api/version` or `/v1/models` as the readiness probe. `/v1/models` lists fully qualified ids such as `docker.io/ai/qwen3.8:latest`; requests may use either that form or the short name.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the marker credential">
    Add to `~/.openclaw/.env` (or export in the Gateway's shell):

    ```bash
    LLMMAN_API_KEY=llmman-local
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the provider and select the model">
    Add the config below, then:

    ```bash
    openclaw models list --provider llmman
    openclaw models set llmman/qwen3.8
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
`llmman launch openclaw --model qwen3.8` can bootstrap a first-run OpenClaw install by running non-interactive onboarding against the llmman endpoint. It only applies when no `openclaw.json` exists yet; for an existing install use the explicit config on this page.
</Note>

## Full config example

Qwen3.8 on a local llmman server:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "llmman/qwen3.8" },
      models: {
        "llmman/qwen3.8": { alias: "Qwen3.8 (llmman)" },
      },
    },
  },
  models: {
    mode: "merge",
    providers: {
      llmman: {
        baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
        apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
        api: "openai-completions",
        timeoutSeconds: 300,
        models: [
          {
            id: "qwen3.8",
            name: "Qwen3.8 (llmman)",
            reasoning: true,
            input: ["text", "image"],
            cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 },
            contextWindow: 65536,
            maxTokens: 8192,
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`models.mode: "merge"` keeps hosted providers available as fallbacks. `timeoutSeconds` gives cold model loads and long generations room before the model request timeout fires.

## Model discovery

llmman is not a bundled OpenClaw plugin, so there is no implicit discovery. List every model you want under `models.providers.llmman.models` with a provider-local `id` (no `llmman/` prefix).

| Behavior     | Detail                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Model ids    | Short (`qwen3.8`, `qwen3.5:9b`), Hugging Face (`unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF`), or fully qualified (`docker.io/ai/qwen3.8:latest`) all work                                 |
| Default tag  | `:latest` when omitted                                                                                                                                                   |
| Capabilities | `llmman show <model>` and `POST /api/show` report `completion` plus `vision` when a companion `mmproj` projector is present; mark such models `input: ["text", "image"]` |
| Reasoning    | Set `reasoning: true` for thinking models such as Qwen3.8; llmman returns thinking as `reasoning_content`                                                                |
| Context      | `llmman show <model>` prints the trained context length; `llmman ps` prints the context the running server was started with                                              |
| Costs        | All `0`; the hosted half of a hybrid ref is billed by that provider, not tracked by OpenClaw                                                                             |

```bash
llmman list
llmman show qwen3.8
openclaw models list --provider llmman
```

To add a model, pull it and add a matching entry:

```bash
llmman pull qwen3.5:9b
```

### Smoke tests

A narrow text probe that skips the full agent tool surface:

```bash
LLMMAN_API_KEY=llmman-local \
  openclaw infer model run \
    --local \
    --model llmman/qwen3.8 \
    --prompt "Reply with exactly: pong" \
    --json
```

Add `--file` with an image for a lean vision-model probe (PNG/JPEG/WebP;
non-image files are rejected before llmman is called; use
`openclaw infer audio transcribe` for audio):

```bash
LLMMAN_API_KEY=llmman-local \
  openclaw infer model run \
    --local \
    --model llmman/gemma4:e4b \
    --prompt "Describe this image in one sentence." \
    --file ./photo.jpg \
    --json
```

Neither path loads chat tools, memory, or session context. If a probe succeeds
while normal agent replies fail, the issue is usually tool-schema handling or
context pressure in the backend, not the endpoint; see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

A full agent turn with tool calling is the real test:

```bash
openclaw agent --local --session-id llmman-smoke \
  --message "Read the file ./README.md with a tool and summarize it in one sentence."
```

## Hybrid inference

llmman can pair a local model with a hosted one under a single model name and
choose a side per request. OpenClaw configures the pair once as an ordinary
model id and gets local-first inference with hosted overflow, without an
agent-level fallback switch.

The reference is `llmman.hybrid/<local>,<provider>/<model>`. With `qwen3.8`
as the local half and OpenAI's `gpt-5.6-luna` as the hosted half:

```text
llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna
```

Which side serves a request:

1. **`x-llmman-route: local` or `cloud`** request header wins. Any other value is a `400`.
2. **Otherwise, size.** A request body larger than the local context can hold goes to the hosted model. The budget is 4 bytes per token of `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH`; `LLMMAN_HYBRID_LOCAL_BYTES` sets it directly and `0` disables the size rule.
3. **Otherwise, local.**

If a request llmman kept local is then refused by the local backend as larger
than its context, llmman resends it to the hosted half before anything reaches
OpenClaw. A `local` pin is never overridden this way. Every routed request is
logged with the side and the reason. The raw completion response may report
the backend model or GGUF path; OpenClaw's result envelope retains the
configured pair ref.

### Hosted-provider key

The hosted half authenticates like any llmman `--provider` request. Pick one:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenClaw presents the key (recommended)">
    Set the llmman provider's `apiKey` to the hosted provider's key. llmman forwards it per request and never persists it. Local-only models on the same provider entry ignore the value.

    ```bash
    # ~/.openclaw/.env
    LLMMAN_API_KEY=sk-...   # your OpenAI API key
    ```

    Keep `apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}"` in the config below.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="llmman holds the key">
    Give the daemon its own key and have OpenClaw send the literal placeholder `llmman`:

    ```bash
    llmman config set providers.openai.api_key sk-...
    llmman serve
    ```

    `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the daemon's environment works too and overrides the config file.

    ```bash
    # ~/.openclaw/.env
    LLMMAN_API_KEY=llmman
    ```

    The placeholder must be exactly `llmman`; any other bearer is treated as a real key and forwarded to the hosted provider. llmman only spends its own key for loopback callers, so this pattern requires the daemon and the Gateway on the same host.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Hybrid config

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "llmman/llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna" },
      models: {
        "llmman/llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna": { alias: "Qwen3.8 + Luna" },
        "llmman/qwen3.8": { alias: "Qwen3.8 local" },
      },
    },
  },
  models: {
    mode: "merge",
    providers: {
      llmman: {
        baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
        apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
        api: "openai-completions",
        timeoutSeconds: 300,
        models: [
          {
            id: "llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
            name: "Qwen3.8 + GPT-5.6 Luna (hybrid)",
            reasoning: true,
            input: ["text", "image"],
            cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 },
            contextWindow: 65536,
            maxTokens: 8192,
          },
          {
            id: "qwen3.8",
            name: "Qwen3.8 (llmman)",
            reasoning: true,
            input: ["text", "image"],
            cost: { input: 0, output: 0, cacheRead: 0, cacheWrite: 0 },
            contextWindow: 65536,
            maxTokens: 8192,
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The daemon computes one hybrid byte budget at startup: 4 bytes per token of
`LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, or `262144 × 4 = 1048576` bytes when unset. This budget
does not follow a model's trained-context cap or a later out-of-memory
reduction. Set `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH=65536` in the daemon's environment to
match the example, or set `LLMMAN_HYBRID_LOCAL_BYTES` to pick the byte budget
directly. An explicit `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH=0` disables size-based routing
unless a positive `LLMMAN_HYBRID_LOCAL_BYTES` supplies a budget; setting the
byte override to `0` also disables that rule. Local context-refusal fallback
still applies unless the request is pinned local.

Set `contextWindow` on the pair to the local model's usable token context. OpenClaw then compacts
around the local model's limit, so most turns stay local; llmman still
overflows to `gpt-5.6-luna` when a request exceeds it. Set it to the hosted
model's window instead if you prefer fewer compactions and more hosted
traffic.

### Pinning a side

OpenClaw sends provider-level `headers` on every request, so a second provider
entry on the same base URL can force one side of the pair:

```json5
{
  models: {
    providers: {
      llmman: {
        baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
        apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
        api: "openai-completions",
        models: [
          {
            id: "llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
            name: "Hybrid",
            input: ["text", "image"],
          },
        ],
      },
      "llmman-cloud": {
        baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
        apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
        api: "openai-completions",
        headers: { "x-llmman-route": "cloud" },
        models: [
          {
            id: "llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
            name: "Hybrid (hosted)",
            input: ["text", "image"],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: "llmman/llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
        fallbacks: ["llmman-cloud/llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Switch with `/model llmman-cloud/...` for a turn that should go hosted, or use
`headers: { "x-llmman-route": "local" }` for an entry that must never leave
the machine.

### Hybrid versus OpenClaw fallbacks

| Mechanism                         | Decides                    | Switches on                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| llmman hybrid pair                | Per request, inside llmman | Request size versus local context, or an explicit route header |
| `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` | Per turn, inside OpenClaw  | Provider errors, timeouts, rate limits, auth failures          |

They compose. A common shape is a hybrid pair as `primary` with a direct hosted
model as a fallback for when llmman itself is down:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: "llmman/llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
        fallbacks: ["openai/gpt-5.6-luna"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Hosted models through llmman

`llmman.provider/<provider>/<model>` forwards to a hosted provider with no
local half. Use it when you want every model, local or hosted, behind one
endpoint and one key-handling story:

```json5
{
  models: {
    providers: {
      llmman: {
        baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
        apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
        api: "openai-completions",
        models: [
          { id: "qwen3.8", name: "Qwen3.8 (llmman)", reasoning: true, input: ["text", "image"] },
          {
            id: "llmman.provider/openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
            name: "GPT-5.6 Luna via llmman",
            reasoning: true,
            input: ["text", "image"],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The provider catalog comes from [models.dev](https://models.dev) and is cached
by the daemon. `llmman providers` shows which providers have a key;
`llmman list --provider openai` lists that provider's models and prices. For
direct hosted access without llmman in the path, configure the
[OpenAI](/providers/openai) provider instead.

## Vision and image description

Models that ship a companion `mmproj` projector are vision-capable; `qwen3.8`
and `gemma4:e4b` are. `llmman show <model>` logs `found companion mmproj file`
and `/api/show` reports a `vision` capability. Mark those models
`input: ["text", "image"]` so image attachments are injected into agent turns.

```bash
llmman pull gemma4:e4b
openclaw infer image describe --file ./photo.jpg --model llmman/gemma4:e4b --json
```

`--model` must be a full `<provider/model>` ref. Use `infer image describe`
for OpenClaw's image-understanding flow and configured `imageModel`; use
`infer model run --file` for a raw multimodal probe with a custom prompt.

To make a llmman model the default image-understanding provider for inbound
media:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      imageModel: {
        primary: "llmman/gemma4:e4b",
      },
    },
  },
  models: {

  tools: {
    media: {
      image: {
        timeoutSeconds: 180,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

OpenClaw rejects image-description requests for models not marked
image-capable. Slow local vision models can need a longer image-understanding
timeout than hosted models; `models.providers.llmman.timeoutSeconds` still
governs the underlying HTTP request for normal model calls.

    <Warning>
    The remote daemon has no authentication. Only do this inside a trusted network, and do not use hybrid refs with "llmman holds the key" against a non-loopback daemon; it refuses to spend its own key for remote callers.
    </Warning>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="On-demand startup">
    OpenClaw starts llmman on demand when a `llmman/...` model is requested. This example keeps the daemon running until OpenClaw exits (`idleStopMs: 0`). Set a positive `idleStopMs` to stop an OpenClaw-started daemon after that many idle milliseconds; this is separate from llmman unloading idle models:

    ```json5
    {
      models: {
        providers: {
          llmman: {
            baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
            apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
            api: "openai-completions",
            timeoutSeconds: 300,
            localService: {
              command: "/opt/homebrew/bin/llmman",
              args: ["serve"],
              env: { LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH: "65536" },
              healthUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1/models",
              readyTimeoutMs: 180000,
              idleStopMs: 0,
            },
            models: [
              {
                id: "qwen3.8",
                name: "Qwen3.8 (llmman)",
                reasoning: true,
                input: ["text", "image"],
                contextWindow: 65536,
                maxTokens: 8192,
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    `command` must be an absolute path; use the output of `which llmman` on the Gateway host. `env` is how the daemon's settings such as `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH` are supplied here. `healthUrl` must be `/v1/models` or `/api/version`, since llmman has no `/health`. The first request after startup also loads the model, so keep `timeoutSeconds` generous. Full field reference: [Local model services](/gateway/local-model-services).

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common recipes

Replace model ids with names from `llmman list` or
`openclaw models list --provider llmman`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local Qwen3.8 as the default agent model">
    ```bash
    llmman pull qwen3.8
    llmman serve
    echo 'LLMMAN_API_KEY=llmman-local' >> ~/.openclaw/.env
    openclaw models set llmman/qwen3.8
    ```

    Use the [Full config example](#full-config-example) for the provider entry, and set `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH=65536` in the daemon's environment if you want the server context to match it exactly.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Local first, hosted overflow">
    The [Hybrid config](#hybrid-config) above: `llmman.hybrid/qwen3.8,openai/gpt-5.6-luna` as `primary`, `LLMMAN_API_KEY` set to the OpenAI key, `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH` matching the pair's `contextWindow`. Add `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` to `fallbacks` so a stopped daemon does not block replies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Small local profile">
    Local models served through a custom `openai-completions` provider use structured [Tool Search](/tools/tool-search) automatically when unset. The explicit setting below pins that surface, keeping optional capabilities available while loading their schemas only when needed. Cap the context to what the host can run with `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH=32768` in the daemon's environment:

    ```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          model: { primary: "llmman/qwen3.8" },
        },
      },
      tools: {
        toolSearch: { mode: "tools" },
      },
      models: {
        providers: {
          llmman: {
            baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
            apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
            api: "openai-completions",
            models: [
              {
                id: "qwen3.8",
                name: "Qwen3.8 (llmman)",
                reasoning: true,
                input: ["text", "image"],
                contextWindow: 32768,
                contextTokens: 32768,
                maxTokens: 4096,
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    Use `compat.supportsTools: false` only when the model or server reliably fails on tool schemas; it disables tool use entirely. For a deliberately narrower agent, prefer `tools.profile` or a per-agent tool policy.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple llmman hosts">
    Custom provider ids when running more than one daemon; each gets its own host, models, and timeout:

    ```json5
    {
      models: {
        providers: {
          "llmman-fast": {
            baseUrl: "http://mini.local:17434/v1",
            apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
            api: "openai-completions",
            models: [{ id: "qwen3.5:9b", name: "qwen3.5:9b", input: ["text"], contextWindow: 32768 }],
          },
          "llmman-large": {
            baseUrl: "http://gpu-box.local:17434/v1",
            apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
            api: "openai-completions",
            timeoutSeconds: 420,
            models: [{ id: "qwen3.8", name: "qwen3.8", reasoning: true, input: ["text", "image"], contextWindow: 131072 }],
          },
        },
      },
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          model: {
            primary: "llmman-fast/qwen3.5:9b",
            fallbacks: ["llmman-large/qwen3.8"],
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    llmman can also pool several daemons itself: `llmman config set aggregation.peers <host>,<host>` (or `LLMMAN_PEERS`) makes one daemon forward to peers, so OpenClaw sees a single endpoint whose model list spans the group.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hugging Face or private-registry models">
    Model ids are whatever llmman resolves. Pull with the full reference and use the same string as the OpenClaw model id:

    ```bash
    llmman pull hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF
    llmman pull ghcr.io/myorg/private-model:v1
    ```

    ```json5
    {
      models: {
        providers: {
          llmman: {
            baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
            apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
            api: "openai-completions",
            models: [
              { id: "hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF", name: "Qwen3.5 0.8B", input: ["text"] },
              { id: "ghcr.io/myorg/private-model:v1", name: "Private model", input: ["text"] },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    The agent ref is then `llmman/hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF`. Run `llmman login <registry>` first for private registries.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Model selection

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: "llmman/qwen3.8",
        fallbacks: ["llmman/qwen3.5:9b", "openai/gpt-5.6-luna"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

For slow local models, prefer provider-scoped tuning before raising the whole
agent runtime timeout: `models.providers.llmman.timeoutSeconds` covers
connection setup, headers, body streaming, and the total guarded-fetch abort
for that provider's model requests only.

### Quick verification

```bash
# llmman daemon visible to this machine
curl http://127.0.0.1:17434/api/version
llmman ps

# OpenClaw catalog and selected model
openclaw models list --provider llmman
openclaw models status

# Direct model smoke
LLMMAN_API_KEY=llmman-local openclaw infer model run \
  --local --model llmman/qwen3.8 --prompt "Reply with exactly: ok" --json
```

For remote hosts, replace `127.0.0.1` with the `baseUrl` host. If `curl` works
but OpenClaw does not, check whether the Gateway runs on a different machine,
container, or service account.

## Advanced configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context windows">
    `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH` is the server-side context (there is no flag). Semantics by backend:

    - **llama-server (GGUF):** set, it is passed as `--ctx-size` for generation models; `0` means the trained context. Unset, llmman uses `262144` or the model's trained context if smaller, and on out-of-memory retries with the context halved down to a 16,384 floor.
    - **vLLM (safetensors):** a positive value becomes `--max-model-len`; unset uses the vLLM default.
    - **mlx_lm.server:** not forwarded.

    `LLMMAN_NUM_PARALLEL` scales `--ctx-size` up by that factor so each slot keeps the full context.

    On the OpenClaw side, `contextWindow` declares the model's window and `contextTokens` caps active input. Keep `contextWindow` at or below the server value; OpenClaw derives compaction and preflight thresholds from it. OpenClaw's `contextWindow` does not change llmman's hybrid byte budget; configure the daemon separately as described in [Hybrid config](#hybrid-config).

    ```json5
    {
      models: {
        providers: {
          llmman: {
            models: [
              {
                id: "qwen3.8",
                name: "qwen3.8",
                contextWindow: 65536,
                contextTokens: 49152,
                maxTokens: 8192,
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thinking control">
    Qwen3.8 thinks by default; llmman returns the reasoning as `reasoning_content`, which OpenClaw's `openai-completions` adapter separates from the final text. Requests are proxied to `llama-server`, so `chat_template_kwargs` passes through. To turn thinking off for agent turns with a local Qwen model:

    ```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          models: {
            "llmman/qwen3.8": {
              params: {
                chat_template_kwargs: { enable_thinking: false },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    For per-run or session control, declare the local Qwen model's thinking format:

    ```json5
    {
      models: {
        providers: {
          llmman: {
            models: [
              {
                id: "qwen3.8",
                name: "Qwen3.8 (llmman)",
                reasoning: true,
                input: ["text", "image"],
                compat: { thinkingFormat: "qwen-chat-template" },
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    With this declaration, `openclaw agent --model llmman/qwen3.8 --thinking off`, `/think off`, and `openclaw infer model run --local --model llmman/qwen3.8 --thinking off --prompt "Reply with exactly: pong" --json` map the thinking setting to `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`. Without it, the generic proxy defaults do not send this control or `reasoning_effort`.

    The lean `infer model run` path does not read the agent-level `params` recipe above; use the compatibility declaration and `--thinking off` for that probe. Do not combine a fixed `enable_thinking` agent param with per-run control, since the fixed param overrides the generated value. Apply Qwen-specific controls to a hybrid ref only if both its local and hosted backends accept them.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model lifecycle and keep-alive">
    Models load on their first request, each in its own backend subprocess, and unload after five idle minutes. Tune with:

    | Variable                   | Meaning                                                                                  |
    | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `LLMMAN_KEEP_ALIVE`        | Idle unload timer (default `5m`); `0` unloads right after each request                    |
    | `LLMMAN_MAX_LOADED_MODELS` | Cap on concurrently loaded models; idle ones are evicted LRU, busy ones return `503`      |
    | `LLMMAN_MAX_QUEUE`         | Pending-request cap before `503` (default `512`)                                          |
    | `LLMMAN_LOAD_TIMEOUT`      | Load stall timeout (default `10m`)                                                       |

    `llmman ps` shows loaded models with their context and expiry; `llmman stop <model>` unloads one now. A first request after startup or an idle unload pays the load cost, so set `timeoutSeconds` on the provider and raise `LLMMAN_KEEP_ALIVE` to keep the daemon warm for chat surfaces.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GPU and backend selection">
    llmman probes CUDA, ROCm, Vulkan (Linux/Windows) or Metal (macOS) and downloads a matching `llama-server` release if none is on `PATH`. Override with `LLMMAN_LLM_LIBRARY`: `cpu`, `cuda`, `cuda13`, `rocm`, `vulkan`, or `metal`. Other knobs: `LLMMAN_FLASH_ATTENTION` (`on`/`off`/`auto`), `LLMMAN_KV_CACHE_TYPE` (`f16`, `q8_0`, `q4_0`), `LLMMAN_SCHED_SPREAD` for multi-GPU layer splitting, `LLMMAN_IGPU_ENABLE` to count integrated GPUs. On Linux, `llmman serve --ociman docker|podman` runs `llama-server` from the `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp` images instead of a local binary. `LLMMAN_DEBUG=1` prints the probe result.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory embeddings">
    llmman serves `/v1/embeddings` for GGUF embedding models, so [memory search](/concepts/memory) can use it through the generic `openai-compatible` embedding provider:

    ```bash
    llmman pull embeddinggemma
    ```

    ```json5
    {
      memory: {
        search: {
          provider: "openai-compatible",
          model: "embeddinggemma",
          remote: {
            baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:17434/v1",
            apiKey: "${LLMMAN_API_KEY}",
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    Embedding models are capped to their trained context regardless of `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH`. See [Memory config](/reference/memory-config#remote-endpoint-config) for the remaining fields.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ollama-compatible API">
    llmman also implements Ollama's native `/api/chat`, `/api/tags`, `/api/show`, and `/api/ps`, and `OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:17434 ollama run <model>` works against it. Prefer `api: "openai-completions"` from OpenClaw anyway: llmman's `/api/show` reports only `completion` and `vision` capabilities, so the bundled Ollama plugin's discovery would mark every llmman model `compat.supportsTools: false`. If you do point the Ollama plugin at `http://127.0.0.1:17434` (no `/v1`), list models explicitly instead of relying on discovery.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compat flags">
    llmman forwards message content and tool schemas to the backend without normalizing them, so compatibility depends on the selected engine and model. Structured content parts (text + image) and OpenClaw's full tool schema work with `qwen3.8` on `llama-server`. If a different backend or model rejects them:

    - `messages[].content: invalid type: sequence, expected a string` → set `compat.requiresStringContent: true` on the model entry. OpenClaw then flattens pure text content parts into plain strings.
    - `400 JSON schema conversion failed` → `llama-server` could not compile a tool schema into its grammar subset. Update OpenClaw first; if a third-party tool or MCP server contributes the offending schema, disable it for that agent, and use `compat.supportsTools: false` only as a last resort.

    ```json5
    {
      models: {
        providers: {
          llmman: {
            models: [
              {
                id: "qwen3.8",
                name: "qwen3.8",
                compat: {
                  requiresStringContent: true,
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Proxy-style behavior">
    Because llmman is a non-native `openai-completions` endpoint, OpenClaw treats it as a proxy route: no `service_tier`, no Responses `store`, no prompt-cache hints, no OpenAI reasoning-compat payload shaping, no hidden OpenClaw attribution headers, and `compat.supportsDeveloperRole` is forced to `false`. Vendor-specific fields can be merged into the request body with `agents.defaults.models["llmman/<model>"].params.extra_body`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model costs">
    Local llmman models are free, so set all costs to `0`. The hosted half of a hybrid or `llmman.provider/...` ref is billed by that provider; `llmman list --provider openai` shows its per-million-token prices.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="curl /v1/models fails">
    `llmman serve` is not running or is not reachable at the configured address. The default is `127.0.0.1:17434`; if you set `LLMMAN_HOST`, update the OpenClaw `baseUrl` and `healthUrl` to match.

    ```bash
    llmman serve
    curl http://127.0.0.1:17434/api/version
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider unavailable or secrets could not be resolved">
    `models.providers.llmman.apiKey: *** env var "LLMMAN_API_KEY"` in the config warnings means the substitution found no value. Add `LLMMAN_API_KEY=llmman-local` to `~/.openclaw/.env`, or replace `"${LLMMAN_API_KEY}"` with the literal `"llmman-local"`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unknown model">
    The model is not pulled, or the id in config does not match what llmman resolves. Compare against `llmman list`; a short name maps to `docker.io/ai/<name>:latest`, and an `owner/repo` name maps to `hf.co/owner/repo`.

    ```bash
    llmman pull qwen3.8
    llmman list
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cold model times out">
    Large models can take minutes to load, especially on the first request after an idle unload. Raise `models.providers.llmman.timeoutSeconds`, warm the model with a first `openclaw infer model run`, and consider a longer `LLMMAN_KEEP_ALIVE` on the daemon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hybrid request fails with no API key for provider">
    llmman routed the request to the hosted half and found no usable key. Either the bearer OpenClaw sent was a marker (`llmman-local`) rather than a real key, or you used the `llmman` placeholder without giving the daemon its own `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or the daemon is bound off loopback and refuses to spend its own key. See [Hosted-provider key](#hosted-provider-key).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hybrid requests never go hosted (or always do)">
    Check the daemon log; every routed request records the side and the reason. Routing is by request body size against `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH` (4 bytes per token) unless `x-llmman-route` is set. Lower `LLMMAN_HYBRID_LOCAL_BYTES` to overflow sooner, raise it to stay local longer, or pin a side with a provider `headers` entry as in [Pinning a side](#pinning-a-side).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Direct /v1/chat/completions calls pass but openclaw infer model run fails">
    Both probes are tool-free, so `compat.supportsTools` cannot change this failure. Check the configured base URL, model id, and `LLMMAN_API_KEY`, inspect the daemon and backend logs, and compare the two request payloads.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model run passes but a normal agent turn fails">
    The agent turn adds a larger prompt and tool schemas. A `400 JSON schema conversion failed` is `llama-server` rejecting a tool schema; update OpenClaw and check third-party tools or MCP servers. Otherwise enable [Tool Search](/tools/tool-search) to defer schemas, confirm the server's actual context allocation, and use `compat.supportsTools: false` only as a last resort. See [Smaller or stricter backends](/gateway/local-models#smaller-or-stricter-backends).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="llama-server crashes on larger agent turns">
    If schema errors are gone but the spawned `llama-server` still crashes on larger turns, treat it as an upstream `llama.cpp` or model limitation. Lower `LLMMAN_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, set `LLMMAN_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0` to reduce memory, or switch the backend or model.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model outputs tool JSON as text">
    Confirm the model's chat template supports tool calling and that the request reached `/v1/chat/completions` (not the Ollama or Anthropic surfaces via a proxy). If the model only calls tools when forced, set `params.extra_body.tool_choice: "required"` on that model ref as described in [Local models](/gateway/local-models#other-openai-compatible-local-proxies).
