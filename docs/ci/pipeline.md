  - You need to know which CI job owns a check
  - You want the order jobs run in and what blocks what
  - You need to satisfy or configure security-sensitive pull request review

OpenClaw CI runs on pushes to `main` that change a path outside `**/*.md` and
`docs/**`, on every non-draft pull request, and on manual dispatch. Docs-only
main pushes skip CI; mixed docs and code pushes still run it. Pull-request docs
scoping is unchanged.
Canonical `main` pushes use a two-slot pipeline keyed by run-number parity, so
at most two integration runs overlap. Each slot is non-canceling and keeps one
coalesced pending tip: a new merge replaces that slot's older pending run
instead of canceling work that already registered a Blacksmith matrix. Runs in
the two slots can complete out of order; exact-head consumers remain bound to
their requested SHA and are unaffected. Pull requests still cancel superseded
heads, and manual dispatches use isolated groups. Draft no-op events use per-run
isolated groups before job gating, so a delayed draft event cannot displace
pending or running ready-for-review CI. `converted_to_draft` keeps the PR-wide
group to cancel earlier CI while skipping its own jobs. Explicit workflow
cancellation and manual dispatch behavior are unchanged; draft isolation adds no
downstream automatic recovery. `preflight` classifies the
diff and turns expensive lanes off when only unrelated areas changed. Ordinary
manual `workflow_dispatch` runs intentionally bypass smart scoping and fan out
the full graph for release candidates and broad validation. Exact-head
`release_gate` fallbacks retain the pull request's macOS, iOS smoke, and native
generated-locale scope instead of forcing unrelated Apple lanes or locale
parity. Native source verification still runs. Android lanes stay opt-in through
`include_android` (or the `release_gate` input). Release-only
plugin coverage lives in the separate
[`Plugin Prerelease`](/ci/release-validation#plugin-prerelease) workflow and only runs from
[`Full Release Validation`](/ci/release-validation#full-release-validation) or an explicit manual
dispatch.

The full named Node plan retains the complete maintainer-tooling family through
`RELEASE_ONLY_TOOLING_SHARDS` and the matching maintainer leaves in mixed fast
configs. Product-only PRs omit this family in both precise and broad fallback
plans. A PR touching a tooling test or owner runs the full family:
`scripts/**`, `src/scripts/**`, `test/**`, `.github/**`, `config/**`, root
package and pnpm inputs, tooling configs, and the other inputs classified as
tooling by the shared changed-path owner in `scripts/test-projects.test-support.mts`.
That owner also covers Docker, agent/Crabbox tooling, app scripts/Fastlane, and
extension scripts/package inputs. The existing tooling Vitest configs and fast
config inventories still determine execution. Maintainer leaves keep their
original ordinary, isolated, or fake-timer config and process pins; filtering a
mixed group retains its product tests and uses separate subset timing identities.
The five `test/scripts/*.e2e.test.ts` product integration gates remain outside
this maintainer tier.

The shipped-updater composition in
`src/cli/update-cli/update-command-legacy-finalize.test.ts` uses the existing
`tooling-isolated` project in this tier. Its real finalizer, native restart,
lease-authority and cancellation-cleanup cases stay intact. Ordinary product
PRs and main pushes omit it; tooling-owner PRs and manual/full-release validation
retain it. Direct file runs and broad `pnpm test src/cli` runs still select its
isolated owner.

Every CI manual dispatch includes the full tooling family. Full Release
Validation's `normal_ci` child dispatches CI on the frozen candidate, where
`Run Node test shard` executes those unchanged tests before the regular release
publication gate accepts the campaign. OpenClaw Release Checks and Plugin
Prerelease are separate proof owners. This is candidate validation, not a test
deferred until promotion. Direct human beta publication with approved
preflight-only evidence remains an explicit existing exception to full-campaign
validation; this tier does not change publication authority.
Fork repositories keep their existing full tooling coverage because they do not
use the canonical changed-test planner. Fork-origin PRs targeting this repository
use the canonical PR selection and retain changed-owner coverage.

Main push plans already omitted named tooling shards; they now also omit the
maintainer leaves previously retained by fast configs, even for tooling-owner
changes. A regression introduced by a later main merge can therefore remain invisible to
main CI until an affected PR or full manual/release validation runs the family.
The PR merge-ref result proves only the tree it tested. The current `ci-gate`
aggregates selected jobs; it does not add a separate tooling proof against later
main revisions.

Scheduled QA runs nightly at 04:41 UTC. Its live runtime job runs the
`gateway-restart-full-access-live` scenario with `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` alongside
the three-restart replay-safety scenario. The Full Access check must preserve
shell access and delegation without repeating the interrupted side effect;
failure fails the job. Both scenarios run serially and retain their reports in
the job's uploaded artifacts.

Partial workflow reruns reuse successful screenshot shards from earlier attempts
of the same run. The reducer still requires matching source and workflow SHAs,
run ID, pinned tooling, artifact digests, and successful captures. It preserves
each family's producer attempt and records the reducer attempt separately;
future-attempt artifacts remain invalid.

Android screenshot capture runs phone and Wear serially on `ubuntu-24.04`, using
the shared Android toolchain action's API 36 phone and API 34 Wear images and KVM
setup. It calls `pnpm android:screenshots`, the script also invoked by the Android
Fastlane release lane, without signing or store credentials. Capture failures,
cancellations, and selected skips fail `openclaw/ci-gate`. Artifacts retain JPEGs,
source/hash manifests, UI dumps, activity starts, and emulator/app diagnostics for
14 days, including available evidence from failed captures.

Selection covers Android app and build inputs, screenshot tooling, shared assets,
native protocol and locale generation inputs, and CI setup. Ordinary JVM tests,
benchmark-only changes, store listing metadata, and documentation do not select capture. Unavailable
changed-path information selects capture. Like iOS screenshots, the lane excludes hourly main,
compatibility targets, and partial npm release scopes. It checks pipeline integrity
and scene readiness; it does not compare pixels against a baseline.

### Test runtime selection

CI's `setup-test-bun` action consumes `scripts/lib/openclaw-bun.json` through
`scripts/stage-openclaw-bun.sh`, the same owner used by the macOS and Tauri apps.
Every pin bump requires **both** the paired CI Bun-lane replay and Bun-only smoke,
and the macOS runtime checks plus two-binary test set, against the same published
fork tag. Neither app nor CI advances if either gate fails; Linux-only runtime
regressions stop the shared repin too. Preserve the last jointly admitted tag
and attach exact-tag evidence to the repin PR. Publication alone is not admission.
Shared pin/stager changes select macOS, Linux companion, and Bun test lanes.
See [the shared pin schema and regeneration](/platforms/mac/dev-setup#shared-bun-pin-and-repin-gate).

Linux test shards select Bun through `scripts/lib/ci-test-runtime.mts`. The
ordinary unit-fast lane partitions its existing file inventory: files with known
Bun failures or additional skips stay on Node, and the compatible remainder runs
on Bun. Those Node files still execute; they are not excluded from CI. The
isolated unit-fast lane runs completely on Bun.

Bun test processes disable the Node-compatible bytecode cache because the pinned
fork generates bytecode during Vitest teardown. Bun's transpiler cache and the
Vitest transform cache remain available. Node orchestration, worker compilation,
and Node test selections retain their existing cache settings.

Bun's Vitest parent completes the canonical SQLite native-close admission before
creating test threads. Each worker inherits that decision, allowing capable
runtimes to reuse readers while negative checks retain conservative cleanup.

Audited ordinary unit-fast tests use Bun's native test runner, including
qualified async callbacks and self-contained zero-argument setup hooks. Hooks
that take a Vitest context retain Vitest: Bun interprets a hook parameter as a
completion callback. Tests that register a pending promise
assertion before settling it retain Vitest: native Bun waits inside that matcher.
The same runtime owner intersects their qualification data with the
canonical inventory and each existing stripe's include patterns. The remaining
compatible files keep Vitest on Bun. Native admission checks test, setup, and
fixture-helper bytes; changed or unreadable inputs return the affected tests to
Vitest without dropping coverage. Production sources remain free to change and
are still exercised. Extra Vitest arguments, including cache-warming collection,
retain the existing Vitest path.

A changed shared setup fingerprint invalidates the entire native cohort.
Refreshing those fingerprints requires fresh qualification of the retained
entries; tests without matching proof keep their Vitest coverage.
CI preflight inspects the recorded fingerprints once per workflow attempt. When
shared setup, test, or fixture-helper inputs change or become unreadable, it adds
one notice and a job-summary section listing the stale entries and affected
inputs. This report does not change runtime selection or fail CI. Shards do not
repeat the notice; local planning and historical targets without the inspector
remain silent.

Native Bun receives explicit file paths, the existing hermetic environment setup,
the repository tsconfig, and the shared test deadline. It disables automatic env
file loading and runs one test process inside the existing plan and worker budget.
The shared process owner retains output watchdogs, interruption handling, and
joined descendant cleanup. Release validation runs the complete Node selection
before the compatible Bun/Vitest and native Bun portions in that same slot;
every result remains required. Native execution adds no CI jobs or worker fanout.

The process lane runs `terminal-pty-bun.test.ts` and the spawn-broker
`event-order.test.ts` and `group-custody.test.ts` files on Bun. The broker tests
exercise inherited `NODE_OPTIONS` preloads; their Windows exclusions remain.
Other process files retain Node. The pinned fork supports `Bun.Terminal.pause()` and `resume()`,
so its native real-PTY cases run on Linux. macOS and Linux select the native PTY
without Node on builds with that capability, including the pinned fork's macOS
child-exit fix. Other Bun
releases keep the Node helper, which requires an installed Node runtime and
skips Bun's `node` shim when selecting it. Windows keeps `node-pty`.
The qualified TypeScript compiler analysis files and `src/library.test.ts` run
on Bun. The pinned fork exposes the child-process pipe handles and stream
reference controls used by TypeScript's synchronous native API. Compiler
assertions in mixed runtime suites remain enabled.
The worker connection-closing-window test is also qualified in the aggregate
and src-only unit owners.
The Code Mode executor runs with Vitest on Bun using the fork's
copy-on-write diagnostics-channel subscriber handling. Markdown render-aware
chunking stays on Node because the pinned WebKit lacks the `Intl.Segmenter`
surrogate-boundary fix needed by that suite.
The complete fake-timer lane, plugin and proxy retention tests, and other
Control UI tests support Bun. Control UI WeakRef-collection proofs in
`desktop-mobile-keyboard.test.ts`, `chat-pane-retention.test.ts`,
`chat-thread-retention.test.ts`, `session-snapshot-store.test.ts`, and
`usage-page-retention.test.ts` stay on Node because JavaScriptCore's
conservative stack scanning can keep an unreachable target alive after a forced
collection. Unqualified V8-specific heap and worker-limit assertions and the
remaining Node-only selections still run on Node.
The missing-Docker test also runs on Bun, using an empty executable directory
instead of an empty `PATH`, which Bun resolves through its default search path.
Other families retain Node until they pass on the pinned fork within their
existing CI resource budgets. Precise PR targets use the existing
test-project planner to find their owners. The runtime owner admits only qualified
configs, exact files, and partitions; ambiguous selections retain Node. No tests
are removed from the selected inventory.

The complete CLI and embedded-agent-run leaf configs also support Bun. Their
existing pools, exclusions, and worker limits remain in effect. CLI-process and
other agent owners keep their separate qualification policies. Dual validation
runs each complete selected owner on Node before Bun in the same worker slot.

Worktree removal recovery (`src/agents/worktrees/service.removal-recovery.test.ts`),
OpenAI realtime worker messaging (`extensions/openai/realtime-quicksilver-peer-worker.test.ts`),
plugin CommonJS interoperability (`src/plugins/plugin-module-generation.interop.test.ts`),
plugin SDK alias boundaries (`src/plugins/sdk-alias.test.ts`),
oxlint configuration (`test/scripts/oxlint-config.test.ts`), and update timeout
diagnostics (`test/scripts/upgrade-survivor-timeout-diagnostics.test.ts`) also
support Bun when qualified files make up the entire exact selection in their
existing scoped owner. Mixed and broad PR selections retain their original Node
invocation. Dual-runtime validation keeps that complete Node selection and adds
only the qualified files selected by the original include patterns.
The pinned hooks-capable fork extends that whole-file qualification to proven
tooling, update, Doctor, handoff, QA, and workspace-hash fixtures. The Crabbox
wrapper suite retains Node because its retained-allocation and source-capsule
short-write cases still fail on Bun.
Whole-file qualification also covers test-project discovery, worker memory
accounting, Gateway and native Codex session-catalog sampling, and diagnostic
memory logging in their existing scoped owners. The native allocation-attribution
case in `diagnostic-heap-profile.test.ts` still skips on Bun, so that file retains
Node ownership.
Five exact UI E2E selections also support Bun: boot module boundaries, device
platform identity, new-session cloud startup recovery, phone stale-build recovery,
and service-worker updates. They retain the ordinary E2E config's resource
projects, pools, bundle ownership and exclusions. This qualification does not
change the dedicated broad or sharded UI E2E jobs or the separate prebuilt config;
those jobs retain their existing Node execution.

The gateway-client leaf config also supports Bun. Its existing ordered
gateway-core/gateway-client stripes use the core leaf's exact-file qualification
and run the client portion on Bun, sequentially in the original worker slot.
Broad and mixed core selections retain Node. Both leaves retain their selected
include patterns and worker limits. Explicit project-parallel overrides other
than one retain the complete Node stripe. Dual-runtime validation keeps the
complete original stripe on Node and adds the qualified core files and client
portion on Bun. The shared
Vitest config resolves `ws` to the installed package so its imports and mocks use
the same module identity on both runtimes.

The complete memory plugin config (`memory-lancedb` and `memory-wiki`) also
supports Bun, with its existing isolated workers and database-worker exclusions.
A paired Linux Testbox comparison on the preceding Bun `ddfce5d01` / WebKit
`4429d113` build with two workers passed the same 53 files,
474 tests, and one platform skip on each runtime. Bun reduced complete test-command
wall time from 58.72s to 52.79s cold and from 43.51s to 38.68s with warm caches
and reversed runtime order: 10–11% faster, with warm aggregate RSS near 3.94 GiB
on both. PR selections use Bun. Full Release Validation's plugin prerelease
batch retains its complete Node inventory and adds Bun after each qualified
memory group in the same worker slot. Unqualified database-worker tests remain
on Node. Both runtimes preserve the selected files, exclusions, and worker caps;
either failing fails the job. Historical targets without dual batch support
retain their original Node execution.

Pull requests and their release-gate fallback run compatible selections on Bun.
Ordinary manual CI, including Full Release Validation's `normal_ci` child, runs
the complete original selection on Node and its compatible portion on Bun
within the same job and worker slot. Other selections run on Node. Main pushes retain Node. Historical targets
without the runtime-selection capability keep their original Node behavior.
The UI job checks its actual config and arguments through the target's runtime
owner, so older unit-only helpers, helpers requiring the retired global FTL flag,
and legacy compatibility targets retain Node.
Current-runner targets use three native shards and three workers per row,
including exact-target Full Release Validation dispatches. Historical
compatibility targets retain their unsharded package command.
The UI runtime partition is applied after Vitest selects each native shard, so
files keep their original shard ownership. Compatible PR selections run the
complete shard on Bun. Dual validation runs the complete UI selection on Node
and then on Bun, including the six retention assertions. Partial runtime
partitions still require the original shard inventory before omitting Node work.
Partitions without browser files retain browser discovery for native sharding
but omit Chromium version checking and Playwright's speculative browser startup.

On both runtimes, non-isolated UI projects without cached test results group
files by environment and options after native sharding. The sequencer targets
96-file batches and spreads smaller environments across the same rounds to
reduce restarts without keeping every compatible file in one long worker run.
Native ordering within each environment, project order, coverage, isolation, and
worker budgets remain unchanged. The batch target is a scheduling heuristic,
not a worker-lifetime or memory limit; the native pool still decides reuse.
Cached projects retain Vitest's failure/duration ordering, and explicit file
shuffling retains its native seeded order.

The UI runtime owner delays FTL compilation with warmup/soon thresholds of
512000/8000. These short-lived workers benefit from less compilation work;
the protected cache publisher uses the same policy when collecting its seven
canonical UI seed files on Bun. PR jobs restore that Bun seed alongside the
Node seed, with separate transform-cache leaves.
The same owner sets `MIMALLOC_PURGE_HOLES_MIN_INTERVAL=1000` to reduce allocator
scavenger work between short UI updates; normal reclamation and default heaps remain enabled.

The test-runtime setup action installs a checksum-pinned prerelease of `openclaw/bun`
only for jobs that need it. The source commit, archive checksum, and executable
checksum live together in `scripts/lib/openclaw-bun.json`, shared by CI and the apps.
The shared stager checks the release zip and manifest against `SHA256SUMS`, then checks
the extracted executable against the manifest. Independent archive and executable
pins keep the selected bytes fixed even if release metadata changes.
The fork owns the backing storage of `node:vm` cached bytecode, so compiled
functions remain valid after the original cache buffer is garbage-collected.
It also keeps allocator ownership during zero-time event-loop polls, while
retaining the idle handoff for polls that can block.

The pinned build pairs Bun `fc53bf8c0fccd0dcbcccfcf75e2c306ab8953cae` with WebKit
`cb8d6f202b5a396caa204ee1bb75d78175aa841a` in prerelease
`openclaw-v1.4.3-20261007-fc53bf8c0f-webkit-cb8d6f202b`.
WebKit advances from `f1e1ca1156` in the previous `667c4ab22c` pin. This build
fixes worker heap-cap termination, detached `import.meta.resolve` origins,
external-URL package validation, and unlimited-child `bun test` deadlines.
It includes GC cadence improvements and wakeups for idle worker event loops
and passive collectors. The release publishes the four Darwin/Linux targets;
Windows publication remains gated on signing.

The build adds an adaptive, bounded `node:vm` compilation cache for large module
graphs. It activates after 1,750 distinct compiled sources and defaults to a
256 MiB byte budget per VM. CI uses these defaults. This cache is separate
from the Node-compatible bytecode cache disabled for Bun test processes above.

The build retains synchronous
`module.registerHooks` resolve/load chains and deregistration. JavaScriptCore
limitations remain explicit: static input attributes are unavailable, static cycles
can repeat resolution, and completed imports can be reused by `require`.
Unsafe in-flight record collisions throw `ERR_MODULE_HOOK_REENTRANCY`, and static
resolve-returned type attributes throw `ERR_MODULE_HOOK_ATTRIBUTE_IDENTITY`.
The plugin loader keeps its Bun-native path even when hooks are available;
tooling and fixtures that call hooks directly use the new implementation.
Hooks receive valid WHATWG URLs for Bun-replaced packages and virtual modules,
while native loading keeps its original module identity. Installed replacements
expose file URLs; missing packages and opaque virtual IDs use `bun-builtin:` and
`bun-virtual:` URLs. This avoids tsx `Invalid URL` failures without replacing Bun's
native implementations.
It retains fixes for child-process
spawn tracing outcomes, preservation of destroy errors during in-flight socket writes,
MessagePort creation async context and emitted payloads, retained duplicated standard
I/O descriptors, inherited `NODE_OPTIONS` preloads, and socket standard I/O shutdown.
Forced full GC now completes in-flight JIT plans, addressing the usage-page retention
failure. The standard I/O
shutdown workaround remains necessary for supported stock Bun releases.
It retains fixes for worker heap capacity reporting, OS-visible `process.title`,
synchronous event-listener exception propagation, and queued WebSocket upgrades.
Runtime auto-install defaults to off: fixtures must declare and install their
dependencies. Darwin watch coalescing does not affect Linux CI.
It retains fixes for post-script `--` argument separators, hidden CommonJS data
exports, large native standard I/O writes, and Darwin kqueue file watches.
It retains fixes for compile-cache idle wakeups, `v8.queryObjects`, idempotent
native readable `ref`/`unref`, the default `module-sync` condition, and
`process.once` wrapper identity.
It retains the upstream Bun sync through `4b02e1031d` and fixes for thread-safe
function ownership, shared-environment deletion, and a module-key crash.
The shared provider-catalog retention test is qualified on this build and runs
on Bun; unqualified tests that assert V8 heap behavior continue to run on Node.
UI retention tests use the local inspector's `HeapProfiler.collectGarbage` on
both runtimes. Only an unavailable inspector method permits the older Bun GC
fallback. The qualified UI inventory has no Node-only subset, so each native
UI shard runs once under `bun-compatible`; `dual` still runs both runtimes.
The fork keeps the lifecycle-script `node` shim in a per-user directory, with a
private fallback when that directory is unusable. `NODE` and `npm_node_execpath`
point to the executable in either location. This lets several accounts on one
host run Bun installs without Node. The same build retains the tsconfig,
diagnostics-channel, and inspector/GC fixes. The render-aware chunking exception
above preserves coverage for the missing WebKit segmentation fix.
Its prerelease tag includes both source revisions because `Bun.revision` alone
does not distinguish builds linked against different WebKit revisions.

Node continues to own orchestration, builds, compiler preparation, and cleanup.
Vitest and its workers use the selected runtime; qualified native selections use
`bun test` and skip Vitest compilation and transform caching. Bun/Vitest, native
Bun, and Node have separate timing identities, and the two Vitest runtimes keep
separate transform-cache directories. Any test engine failing fails the job.
This adds no matrix rows or runner registrations.

`NODE_OPTIONS`, where configured, limits Node heaps; the UI lane retains Node's
default heap limit. Bun does not use that V8 limit. Compare observed memory use alongside elapsed time before admitting more
lanes. Compatibility evidence must use the exact fork build installed by CI;
stock Bun results and different fork revisions are separate measurements.

### Node execution and runtime compatibility

Most Node test, lint, and typecheck jobs currently inherit `24.x` from
`.github/actions/setup-node-env`; the Node shard also supplies that default
explicitly. The composite's `ensure-node.sh` reuses a matching active or cached
runtime before downloading one. A wildcard therefore does not guarantee the
newest patch. Compare exact versions when measuring a toolchain change, and
measure setup separately from the test body.

Preflight's manifest bootstrap uses the exact `NODE_VERSION` pin in `ci.yml`
(24.21.0). Unlike the repository helper, `actions/setup-node` can satisfy a
`24.x` request from an older cached patch below OpenClaw's support floor.

CI's execution version does not define the supported user runtime matrix.
`package.json` accepts Node 24.16+ and Node 26.1+. The full manual CI graph checks
the Node 24.16.0 floor; `node-runtime-compat.yml` checks Node 26.1.0 weekly and on
dispatch. Current packaged fresh-install and upgrade checks run on both
Node 24.21.0 and Node 26.1.0, with Windows Node 24 fresh-install proof on 24.16.0.
Both runtime variants use the same candidate package. These support cells stay
independent of changes to the ordinary execution pin; source/build smoke alone
does not prove an installed upgrade. See the
[package validation matrix](/ci/release-validation/package-acceptance).

Select a supported Node runtime before project commands, including lightweight
workflow checks and release orchestration. Hosted images can default to Node 22;
an absent version pin does not prove a supported runtime. Runner images can also
contain unused older toolchains, and recovery bundles intentionally retain
older syntax targets so unsupported runtimes can print upgrade diagnostics.
Those are separate from the supported runtime and test-job versions. GitHub
JavaScript actions also have their own runtime, independent of the `node` on
the job's `PATH`.

### iOS simulator evidence

iOS and Watch simulator test commands write complete `xcodebuild` output directly
to files. Forwarding simulator logs into a congested Actions pipe can stall timed
test operations before their mocked transport runs. After each command exits,
CI prints at most 8 KiB of its log and preserves its exit status. The lifecycle
evidence artifact retains the full logs alongside `.xcresult` bundles on success
and failure; test timeouts, assertions, and diagnostic collection stay unchanged.

### macOS Swift phases

`macos-swift (tests)` builds and runs the app's complete default- and named-profile
test partitions with coverage. `macos-swift (packages)` independently runs the
OpenClawKit Talk-trait opt-out build, OpenClawKit tests, and Swabble tests. These
separate package graphs previously ran before the app build in one job; a hosted
baseline spent 7m57s on them in a 21m48s job. Separating them gives app compilation
and tests their own 30-minute budget without removing coverage or increasing
test-process parallelism.

App tests run in three sequential launcher invocations: the default-profile suite,
rendered Quick Chat in a fresh default-profile process, then named-profile fixtures.
The rendered suite keeps its catalog, disclosure, and shortcut flows together and
separate from tests that change the process-wide executor. Each partition retains
coverage instrumentation and completion checks; a failure stops later partitions.
Rendered Quick Chat uses an AppKit-owned run loop for native menu tracking.
Historical targets with a launcher retain their original default- and named-profile
partitions, including XCTest's rendered-flow ordering.

Each launcher invocation retains a full log in the `macos-native-test-logs`
artifact. CI forwards only a bounded tail after the invocation exits, keeping
Actions log backpressure outside the tests while preserving process and output
closure checks before resource cleanup.
The default-profile capture artifact retains each invocation's directory, so
browser sign-in captures from the bulk suite survive the later Quick Chat run.

Both phases use Xcode 27 on GitHub-hosted `xcode-27`, the preview macOS 27
image, with at most two concurrent jobs. Full manual
validation adds the existing `release` phase under the same cap. The package split adds one
hosted Mac job and its checkout/setup cost per selected run, with no additional
Blacksmith registrations. Compare complete hosted timings, including queue and
setup time, before treating the removed serial work as an observed speedup.

The Xcode 27 rollout preserves the existing hosted placement, job counts,
30-minute phase budgets, coverage, and Swift 6.3 source-language minimum.
Native builds/tests and complete job timings must qualify the new toolchain;
the earlier package-split measurement does not establish its performance.

Only the app phases restore the app build cache. SwiftPM dependency caches remain
restore-only in `packages`; the existing primary phase owns shared cache writes.
The aggregate gate requires every selected phase to succeed.

Debug Swift CI builds omit the IDE index and use line-table debug information.
Coverage instrumentation and source-line backtraces remain enabled; interactive
debugger type/value inspection requires a normal local debug build. The app test
cache uses a separate build profile so it cannot restore the old indexed products;
Release build flags and caches remain unchanged.

The macOS Periphery jobs build tests with the native SwiftPM backend and its
scratch directory and index store under `.cache/periphery-swift`, then scan that
index with `--skip-build`. An explicit index path makes Periphery skip its build.
Periphery 3.8 unconditionally excludes `.build` sources, which would hide first-party protocol
models generated by the SwiftPM plugin. The separate scratch path makes those
models visible while its dependency checkouts remain excluded. Native test
crashes emit noninteractive Swift backtraces, without register dumps.

Ordinary Markdown and MDX pages under `docs/`, plus root `README.md`, retain
their separate `check-docs` coverage beside precise pull-request Node tests.
Page deletions and renames preserve this targeting. Explicit Node owners for
Markdown inputs remain selected; workspace templates under
`docs/reference/templates/` and unowned source inputs retain the full fallback.

When `docker-seed-e2e` selects the published upgrade survivor, it uploads
`docker-seed-upgrade-survivor-proof` even after a failure. The artifact contains
scheduler summaries and sanitized survivor reports. Failed reports include
bounded, redacted baseline and candidate agent-turn output; private scenario
state and raw logs remain outside the upload.

Full canonical `main` pushes run the operator config and prior-release state
startup corpora once through the Node `runtime-config` owner. Canonical pull
requests also omit the duplicate **Check startup corpus** step when preflight
certifies every corpus file in the required Node matrix on the exact same
checkout revision. Partial, filtered or unknown plans retain the explicit step;
release-gate dispatches retain their separate merge-tree proof. Both state
repair passes, all static baseline ratchets and required Node failure aggregation
remain unchanged.
Eight state test files share one matrix inventory so the executor can distribute
all release/config pairs across workers. Each pair still runs both Doctor and
Gateway startup checks. The explicit step prepares the runtime once with
`pnpm build qaRuntime`, then runs the config corpus and all eight state files in
one Vitest process with at most four workers. A failed preparation stops the step
before workers consume memory or attempt their own builds. Frozen targets from
before the file split retain their config process and four state processes,
admitted in batches with one slot per four available CPUs (at least one slot).
A failed corpus run is reported while the remaining shards still run.
The corpus uses the normal bundled-plugin resolver to select the prepared
runtime from this checkout instead of forcing TypeScript plugin entrypoints.
Plugins whose Doctor contracts require source loading retain that behavior;
the complete config/state matrix and its assertions remain intact.

Ordinary pull requests that change only independent Control UI unit-test entries
keep all three UI unit rows and existing type/lint gates,
without repeating dedicated UI E2E jobs. Browser and Node test entries, shared
fixtures/helpers, production or build inputs, and tests imported by another
owner retain E2E coverage. Main pushes, manual validation, and frozen targets
keep their existing selection.

The `docker-seed-e2e` job uses `resolveDockerSeedLanes` from
`scripts/lib/ci-docker-seed-plan.mts` to select exactly
`published-upgrade-survivor` on every admitted canonical `main` run, independently
of changed paths. Docs-only pushes remain excluded at the trigger. The lane runs
`legacy-operator-state` against an exact published predecessor with `auto-auth`:
the published driver must update and replace the running managed Gateway.
Schema refusal or rollback fails the gate. Operator state, plugin convergence,
cron ownership, agent turns, no-op updates, and backup rollback assertions remain.

Main, including hourly `validation_tier=main` dispatches, prepares its smoke tarball with `pnpm build:ci-artifacts` followed by
`scripts/package-openclaw-for-docker.mjs --skip-build`. This retains all runtime
JavaScript, plugin assets, Control UI, metadata, and public SDK declarations;
the canonical packer still runs its complete tarball integrity check. The
scheduler consumes that tarball through `OPENCLAW_CURRENT_PACKAGE_TGZ` without
rebuilding it. Full Release Validation children use the same smoke package;
ordinary full-tier manual CI retains the declaration-complete full package build.

Ordinary canonical manual CI retains the survivor and adds
`cron-mcp-cleanup`, `mcp-channels`, `mcp-code-mode-gateway`, and
`update-channel-switch`. This includes Full Release Validation's `normal_ci`
child in `full`, `npm-beta`, and `npm-stable` scopes. Frozen targets
must declare the Docker seed capability; targets without `resolveDockerSeedLanes`
retain the survivor fallback. CI loads the target's Docker tier planner directly.

The scheduler retains one 16-class Blacksmith runner on eligible main pushes.
Full Release Validation children also use that class when no release runner group
is configured; hosted outage overrides and retries retain hosted recovery.
Main, release, and ordinary manual CI retain serial weighted admission. Pull requests and their
exact-head fallback dispatches do not select this proof. Installed-driver
upgrade coverage remains required on every admitted canonical main run and
ordinary manual/release CI; the existing infrastructure timeout stays unchanged.
The job is part of `openclaw/ci-gate`. It uses at most one runner registration per
selected run; widening survivor selection does not increase the full-inventory
registration cap, job count, or matrix fanout.

Standalone Periphery workflows enforce zero dead-code findings for the iOS and macOS apps. The shared OpenClawKit workflow scans both consumers in parallel and reports a declaration only when Periphery emits the same Swift USR from both builds. Its generated `GenerateGatewayProtocol/GatewayModels.swift` build-plugin output is retained as generator-owned code rather than treated as app-local dead code. The shared scan and native CI jobs install the filtered gateway-protocol generator dependencies alongside their existing native asset dependencies; CodeQL installs the same generator dependencies before its Swift build.

All four scans use `scripts/install-periphery.sh` to install the checksum-pinned Periphery 3.8.0 OSS release, including its adjacent `libIndexStore.dylib`, in a dedicated runner-temporary directory. The installer rejects download, checksum, and version failures without falling back to Homebrew. Installer changes select all three native workflows.

[Upstream archived the OSS project](https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery/commit/56a0eb6fb97b785c8fbc1044ccbc7b5d9f06ebec). The pin remains a maintainer-owned bridge, not a claim of ongoing upstream support. All four scans target Xcode 27 on GitHub-hosted `xcode-27`. Toolchain, pinned-release, or analyzer changes require native compatibility proof for both app scans and both shared consumers, preserving the zero-findings policy and exact-USR intersection without a baseline or weaker fallback. Four declaration-specific annotations retain confirmed SwiftUI false positives; they do not exclude their files or runtime tests from validation.

## Security review checks

Security review separates product changes that maintainers can approve from the
small set of security policy and enforcement files that require SecOps approval.

| Change                                     | User account with `maintain` or `admin` access   | Other authors                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sensitive product code                     | Informational notice; no extra security approval | `/allow-security-sensitive-change` from a user with `maintain` or `admin` access |
| Dependency changes requiring review        | Same maintainer exemption                        | `/allow-dependencies-change` from a user with either role                        |
| SecOps-owned files in `.github/CODEOWNERS` | Independent SecOps code-owner approval           | Independent SecOps code-owner approval                                           |

The **Security Review** workflow runs both guards from trusted repository code.
It publishes a commit status named `openclaw/ci-gate` that requires both the
applicable approvals and a successful native CI gate from the latest applicable
CI run for the current PR head. Completed, wholly skipped pull-request runs do
not replace substantive CI runs. Newer running, failed, or canceled runs still
take precedence, and skipped release-gate dispatches still block approval. The
existing CI job retains its check with the same name.
GitHub requires both the check and the commit status when both share a required
context. Missing approval, failed CI, or evaluation errors fail the review status.
Missing or running CI leaves it pending and keeps merging blocked. CI completion
automatically evaluates it again. Approval comments do not rerun the test suite.

Every ten minutes, the resolver reconciles CI completions
from five minutes before the previous successful scheduled pass started until
five minutes ago (sixty-minute fallback, twelve-hour cap). Passes tile without gaps;
late or dropped cron ticks only widen the next window, up to the cap. Run listing
covers creation times from three hours before the window through the current time.
GitHub caps each filtered query at 1,000 results, so the resolver bisects ranges
whose reported total exceeds that limit. Each smaller range is paged until a short
page, and its distinct run count must cover the total reported on its first page.
Ten full pages or fewer distinct runs than reported fail the pass before any
status publication or matrix output, retaining the anchor for a complete retry.
Inclusive range endpoints are separated by one second, and run IDs are deduplicated
across pages and slices. A range shorter than ten minutes that still exceeds
1,000 runs fails before status publication or matrix output, so the covered window
does not advance. The next pass rescans from the last successful pass.
Scheduled resolver passes share one
concurrency group without canceling an active pass; GitHub keeps one
pending pass, which still starts from the last successful window.
Each pass selects at most 100 PR heads, oldest CI completion first, with run ID
breaking ties, and stops reading statuses when the cap is reached. If candidates
remain, the `reconcile-backlog` job fails the workflow after the selected reviews
finish. This keeps the same anchor: reviewed heads have fresh statuses, allowing
the next scheduled pass to select the remainder from the same window.

After a reconciler outage longer than twelve hours, older lost completions need
a new push or a Security Review rerun.

A CI rerun keeps its original creation time. A rerun of a run created more than
three hours before the window relies on its own completion delivery; if that is
lost, a new push or a Security Review rerun recovers it.

The resolver reads each head's status history in reverse chronological order and
uses only the newest `openclaw/ci-gate` status from `github-actions[bot]` with creator
type `Bot`. Other publishers are ignored. It schedules normal review when that
Actions-owned status is missing, older than CI completion, or pending. Only a
non-pending status created at or after CI completion is settled and stops
reselection. Every pending status remains eligible, including a review wait
published after a pre-completion CI read. Tiled windows bound the harmless extra
review when a head legitimately waits on newer in-progress CI. Wholly skipped
runs are ignored. It never checks out PR code.
Each pass costs one hosted `ubuntu-24.04` resolver job,
run-list reads plus paginated status-history reads per newly completed head,
and no Blacksmith registrations.

The Security Review Actions job succeeds when evaluation completes, including
when the required commit status blocks merging for missing approval or failed CI.
This prevents an earlier evaluation from leaving a stale failed job after automatic
reevaluation clears the status. Evaluation errors still fail the job and keep the
required status closed.

If the PR head changes before or during evaluation, the obsolete run stops
successfully without publishing approval for the replacement commit. The new
head's automatic event owns its evaluation. Closing an unmerged PR, making it a
draft, or changing its target also stops the obsolete evaluation successfully.
Identity and permission changes and real evaluation errors still fail; a lifecycle
change does not hide an earlier guard error.

A merge of the scheduled revision lets the security evaluation finish, including
when enforcement starts after the merge. Both guards retain their findings in
statuses, comments, and workflow summaries so a force-merge does not discard that
evidence. Automatic lockfile cleanup still requires an open PR immediately before
its write. The resolver selects only open PRs, so this does not schedule new
post-merge reviews. If ordinary CI is still running, the combined status can remain
pending after merge; the CI workflow retains its own final result.

During long read sequences, the review checks the live
PR again before admitting another read after 30 seconds. Non-quota recovery waits
check every 30 seconds too, so superseded work stops without finishing pagination
or waiting out diff recovery. In-flight requests retain their 30-second deadline;
writes and autoscrub cleanup are not interrupted. Server-directed rate-limit
waits must finish before another API request is allowed. Checkout and runtime
setup are outside these checkpoints. Per-head non-canceling publication
serialization and all final approval checks remain unchanged.

When GitHub returns a rate-limit response, the resolver and review scripts stop
API requests, honor `Retry-After` and exhausted-quota reset times, and restart
with fresh PR, approval, role, and CI data. Each script permits up to three restarts
within a shared 65-minute deadline for its job; individual HTTP requests still
have a 30-second timeout. Secondary limits without timing guidance use at least
one minute of exponential backoff. Small randomized delays spread retries after
quota resets. Jobs have a 75-minute ceiling, and waiting occupies their runner.
Recovery is automatic in the same run and does not require another PR event or
manual dispatch. Exhausted recovery fails the job; GitHub errors can also prevent
a new status from being published. Ordinary permission errors and other
evaluation errors are not retried.
Checkout, runtime setup, and separately minted autoscrub token expiry are outside
this recovery mechanism.

Transient commit-status publication failures also restart the complete evaluation.
HTTP `500`, `502`, `503`, and `504` responses and recognized connection failures
use one-, two-, and four-second delays, sharing the three-restart limit and job
deadline with rate-limit recovery. GitHub may have accepted the failed write, so
the review rereads current PR, approval, role, and CI data instead of replaying an
old decision. This recovery applies only to commit-status publication; other
uncertain writes, cancellation, and write request timeouts remain errors.

Separately, read-only `GET` and `HEAD` requests retry HTTP `500`, `502`, `503`,
and `504` responses and recognized transient connection failures before headers
arrive or while reading a successful response body. They share one retry budget
of one, two, and four seconds, within the original 30-second request timeout.
These retries exclude writes, caller cancellation, certificate errors, invalid
JSON, oversized responses, and unrecognized errors. HTTP, connection, and
response-body errors identify the request method and endpoint.

If a read-only request reaches its 30-second deadline, including while reading
its response body, the script restarts the complete evaluation with fresh PR,
approval, role, and CI data. These restarts use one-, two-, and four-second delays
and share the existing three-restart limit and job deadline. A persistent read
timeout fails the job. Write timeouts do not trigger this recovery because GitHub
may already have accepted the mutation.

If GitHub's changed-file count and file list disagree, or the count changes after
validation, the script restarts the complete evaluation after one, two, and four
minutes. These retries share the three-restart limit and job deadline with API
recovery. Each attempt rereads the full file list, PR metadata, approvals, roles,
and CI state; target, author, and other approval-relevant metadata must still
match the original evaluation. A newer head supersedes the obsolete run.
Both guards share each attempt's validated file list. Recovery also runs within
the detection step, so a recovered mismatch does not leave an earlier step red.
A persistent mismatch fails the review and reports the expected, returned, and
current file counts.

The **Security Sensitive Guard** publishes `openclaw/security-sensitive-review`.
Its inventory in `.github/security-review-policy.yml` covers Gateway
authentication, pairing and permissions; credentials, secrets and redaction;
sandbox and execution policies; product security checks; and `.gitignore`.
Ordinary documentation, tests, and test support do not trigger this inventory.
Renames inspect both the old and new paths so moving a sensitive file does not
remove its review requirement.

The **Dependency Guard** publishes `openclaw/dependency-review` and retains its
dependency classification and lockfile autoscrub behavior. Dependency removals
that already qualify as informational remain informational.
Automatic lockfile cleanup is best effort. If neither cleanup App can provide a
write token, or GitHub explicitly denies the cleanup mutation's permissions, the
dependency notice explains how to remove the remaining changes or request
maintainer approval. These expected access limitations do not fail the Actions
job or satisfy dependency review. Unexpected cleanup errors remain failures.

Edit `.github/security-review-policy.yml` to change path classification. Its
`categories` group product paths with descriptions and review guidance;
`exclude` names the product-only exclusions; and `dependencies` lists manifests,
lockfiles, and other dependency files. Paths are quoted, repository-relative
globs: `*` stays within a path segment, `**` crosses directories, and `{a,b}`
matches either alternative. Hidden paths are included. Matching is
case-sensitive unless an exclusion explicitly sets `case-insensitive: true`.
Product exclusions never exempt dependency changes. The first matching product
category supplies the notice's guidance; matches are not CODEOWNERS rules.

The JavaScript loader handles validation and matching; it contains no path
inventory. Invalid policy fails security review. Both the
YAML inventory and its loader require SecOps code-owner approval. The workflow
loads them from the trusted checkout and installs only the locked parser/matcher
runtime through `.github/actions/setup-security-review`, with lifecycle scripts
and dependency caches disabled. That action's manifest and npm lock mirror the
root dependency pins and `pnpm-lock.yaml`; update them together when those pins
change. Approval decisions and dependency graph analysis remain in JavaScript.

Both guards use current repository permissions. Only GitHub user accounts with
`maintain` or `admin` access can grant command approval or receive the author exemption.
`write` access and organization membership are insufficient. A maintainer pushing
to an external contributor's branch does not transfer the author exemption.
Automation using a GitHub user account qualifies under the same role check;
GitHub App bot identities do not qualify.

For other authors, wait for the applicable guard notice to show the current PR
commit, then post the command on its own line in a new PR comment:

```text
/allow-security-sensitive-change
/allow-dependencies-change
```

Each command approves only its own guard. When both guards require approval, both
commands are required and can appear on separate lines in one comment. Use only
command lines in that comment, without prose, quotes, or code fences. Normal
GitHub **Approve** reviews and labels do not replace these commands.

The guard associates a command with the revision recorded in its trusted notice.
A command posted before the notice requests approval for that revision cannot
approve it. After a new commit, wait for the notice to update and post a new
comment. Editing an older comment does not grant fresh approval. Deleting an
approval comment or removing its command revokes that approval; current roles
are checked again whenever the guard runs.

GitHub commit statuses apply to a commit rather than one PR. Before publishing
success, security review verifies that the head belongs to only the current open
PR targeting that base branch. Duplicate heads block approval so one PR cannot
reuse another PR's author exemption or command. Close the duplicate PR or push a
distinct commit; security review evaluates the affected PRs automatically.

Each guard updates one PR comment with affected files, review guidance, the
current revision, and the remaining action. The sensitive-change label remains
after approval so reviewers can still identify the affected responsibility.
Trusted `issue_comment` events reevaluate approval commands and edits or
deletions of approval comments automatically. Edits inspect both the previous
and current text so removing a command still revokes approval. Ordinary comment
activity does not reevaluate the guards or change their statuses. Command mentions
in prose, quotes, or code fences are not approval comments. The workflow filters
ordinary comments before allocating a runner; a command mention can start the
lightweight resolver, which validates the syntax before scheduling review.
Both guards share one review job, and comment events do not rerun the test suite.
Evaluation uses trusted repository code and GitHub metadata without
executing contributor code or comment text.

The hard tier lives only in `.github/CODEOWNERS`: security policy, ownership,
CodeQL, selected scanning configuration, and the security-review enforcement
closure. Keep SecOps as the sole owner on those entries. GitHub accepts any owner
on a matching line, and later matching patterns replace earlier ownership. The
release-manager entries retain their separate approval responsibility. This
inventory does not make every general CI or scanner change SecOps-owned.

The soft tier protects the review flow for fork contributors. It is not a
security boundary against hostile repository writers: another workflow with a
write token can publish the same status context. Binding the required context to
the GitHub Actions app identifies the publisher app, not the specific workflow.
This is an accepted tradeoff to avoid a separate credential-bearing publisher.
The existing maintainer CI bypass also permits bypassing missing command approvals.
Native CODEOWNERS review enforcement remains independent of these statuses and
that CI bypass.

Results apply to the PR head evaluated by the workflow. New PR heads, base-branch
retargeting, command comment events, and CI completion reevaluate automatically;
ten-minute reconciliation recovers lost CI-completion deliveries. Unrelated pushes
to `main` do not. Sensitive-path policy and permission changes
take effect on the next automatic evaluation. Guard execution does not require
manual dispatches or manual reruns.

### Enable enforcement after deployment

Merging workflow files does not enable GitHub merge protection. After the
workflow and the reviewed CODEOWNERS inventory are on the default branch:

1. Keep `openclaw/ci-gate` required and bound to the GitHub Actions app. Preserve
   the existing maintainer bypass and leave **Require branches to be up to date**
   disabled. The two review statuses remain visible without separate required-check entries.
2. Verify the native CI check and security review commit status on a PR's current
   head, including after command approval, a subsequent push, and CI completion.
   Confirm approval updates do not start another test run.
3. In a separate ruleset with no bypass actors, enable **Require a pull request**,
   **Require review from Code Owners**, and **Dismiss stale pull request
   approvals when new commits are pushed**. Verify that `openclaw-secops` is
   eligible for code ownership and that its approval is required for the hard
   inventory. Keep the general required approval count at zero if ordinary
   unowned changes should retain their existing review policy; code-owner review
   is a separate requirement. Existing release-manager entries also become required.
4. Verify that the CI bypass cannot skip the separate code-owner review rule.
   Requiring a PR also restricts direct pushes to the protected branch.

Verify the live GitHub settings and the maintainer, external contributor,
automation account, and SecOps-owned-path cases before declaring enforcement active.

## Fail-fast order

1. `preflight` decides which lanes exist at all. The `docs-scope` and `changed-scope` logic are steps inside this job, not standalone jobs. Canonical `main` starts immediately in one of two parity slots; each slot admits one complete run and coalesces later pushes into its newest pending tip. Downstream jobs wait for the manifest, then eligible Blacksmith jobs restore exact dependencies from the trusted warmer or fall back to the ordinary pnpm-store cache on a miss. Pushes, pull requests, and manual runs targeting the workflow revision run preflight with native Node and skip dependency setup. Manual runs targeting a different revision install dependencies and retain that target's `tsx` tooling.
2. `security-fast`, `check-*`, `check-additional-*`, `check-docs`, and `skills-python` fail quickly without waiting on the heavier artifact and platform matrix jobs. Additional checks start directly after preflight. Narrow PRs with additional checks also place the existing `check-guards` and `check-dependencies` rows there: their complete guard, dependency, unused-file, and export scans do not consume the installed compiler/lint plan. Guards use the same commands and fetch the exact comparison base during checkout. Full selections and runs without that family retain the central rows, and the aggregate requires each selected owner. Extension-only compiler inputs can be planned from the four noncore graphs when an already selected additional boundary row owns the full core graph check. This requires existing regular source files without symlink aliases; mixed source changes retain complete discovery, and missing or uncertain inputs retain full checking. Known full selections skip discovery and retain boundary proof in an already selected additional boundary row or the required planner. No extra boundary row is admitted for that optimization. Ordinary pull-request, push, and scheduled CI skip the production dependency audit. Only `workflow_dispatch` IDs beginning with `full-release-validation-` or `release-native-android-` run it. The audit sends one complete graph with up to four attempts and a four-minute total request budget, including retries and response reading. Every non-zero audit exit produces a warning and exits 0, including findings, unavailable advisories, and invalid data. An unavailable audit is incomplete coverage, not a clean result. The optional pre-commit audit hook uses the same warn-only wrapper. The separate daily [Dependency Audit](/ci/scheduled-workflows#dependency-audit) remains strict for triage, is not a required PR check, and points to a dependency-bump follow-up. Release dependency evidence retains its separate known-malware gate; vulnerability advisories remain warnings.
3. `build-artifacts` and the locale checks overlap with the fast Linux lanes. Control UI and native app source PRs exclude generated locale snapshots/resources; their serialized refresh workflows repair and auto-merge isolated generated PRs in the background. Source CI still blocks stale source inventories and unsafe localization calls. Generated PRs, manual CI, and release prep enforce full translated/platform-generated parity. Canonical `release/YYYY.M.PATCH` branches may include release-prep locale repairs with the other generated release output.
4. Baseline ratchets and selected Node test shards start independently after preflight. Node rows consume the manifest, not ratchet outputs. `ci-gate` still requires every selected ratchet to pass, and the PR failure monitor still cancels remaining work after a ratchet failure. Frozen targets retain their existing ratchet selection.
5. Current plans with guards run `check:coercion-helpers` there once; fast-only plans retain its standalone row. Other platform and runtime lanes fan out independently: `checks-fast-core` (including startup corpus), `checks-fast-contracts-plugins`, `checks-fast-contracts-channels`, `checks-windows`, `macos-node`, `macos-swift`, `ios-build`, the screenshot shards, and `android`.
6. For canonical-repository PRs selecting Node rows, `pr-fail-fast` watches the first attempt and classifies failures before cancelling eligible same-repository work. Fork PR monitoring is read-only and never requests cancellation; unknown failures remain blocking through normal lane results. Only that job has `actions: write`. It starts after preflight and observes failures while the installed check planner queues or runs. Clean completion combines preflight's other job counts with the planner's exact admitted check count, published by its successful `CI check job count v1: N` step. It rechecks the current PR head, auto-merge setting, and newer runs before cancellation. The preflight-owned `ci:no-fail-fast` label fact disables both this monitor and native matrix fail-fast for that run. Add the label before triggering the run; label changes alone do not start CI. Canonical PR reruns let every Node matrix leg finish so inherited main failures cannot cancel the remaining proof needed for an explicit admin landing. Native matrix fail-fast applies only to unlabeled PRs whose workflow repository is not `openclaw/openclaw`, on any attempt. The monitor checks out trusted base-revision scripts. It adds one 4-vCPU Blacksmith registration per eligible same-repository PR, or uses hosted Ubuntu for fork PRs and under the outage override. The hybrid hosted admission owner reserves that fork row before spending the unchanged 45-row optional-offload budget. Main, manual runs, and retries do not start it. Observation ends before the monitor's job limit; ordinary lane verification still owns the result when no failure was observed. Partial reruns ignore monitor causes and results retained from earlier attempts.
7. `openclaw/ci-gate` waits for every selected lane. Preflight and security must succeed; downstream jobs may skip only when unselected by the manifest and existing event, runner, and compatibility conditions. An unexpected selected skip or any failed or canceled downstream job fails the aggregate. Failure-triggered cancellation preserves the originating job's identity and runs the gate to report failure, including a cancellation request with an uncertain response. The existing critical-path route already keeps trusted hybrid first attempts on the 4-vCPU Blacksmith class. A first-attempt same-repository failure also uses that class under the default or explicit Blacksmith profile so hosted assignment cannot consume the cancellation grace period. Retries and the GitHub outage override retain hosted aggregation. A superseded run without a recorded failure cause skips final reporting and releases its concurrency slot as before.

Bot-authored, same-repository PRs containing only generated native locale data
and resources retain strict native source and generated-parity verification,
while omitting unrelated Node and native builds. Source changes, empty or unknown
diffs, and base Android XML without a hard-generated companion keep ordinary
selection. Add `ci:full` before the next PR run to retain ordinary selection for
that generated cohort. Labels alone do not trigger extra CI runs. Main and manual
validation keep their normal coverage.

The monitor reads the latest completed hourly main run directly from GitHub.
A supported Node Vitest assertion, compiler diagnostic, or hosted lint diagnostic
is advisory only when its file and complete signature match main, and the PR
changes neither the file nor its direct subjects. Subject ownership conservatively
includes the file directory, directories of relative imports, and verified
workspace package directories; unresolved imports retain blocking behavior.
Workflow, tooling, configuration, and dependency changes cannot use this exception.
The main run must descend from the PR merge base, or validate current main itself.
Later main changes to those subjects retire the exception before the next hourly run.
Both matrix siblings and packed test groups finish before the monitor emits an
attempt-bound receipt. The shard runner records complete plan and process counts
after cleanup; the monitor reconciles every inner invocation with its native test
summaries. Compiler graphs and hosted lint stripes likewise require joined native
diagnostics and complete group and step receipts. These runners finish ordinary
diagnostic failures before reporting coverage. Mixed or narrowed lint commands
without that complete contract retain blocking behavior. The aggregate then
annotates **known main red, owned by main**.
Missing or incomplete evidence, suite/import errors, boundary checks,
and every unmatched or PR-owned failure stay blocking, including tiny lint and
type errors. The separate maintainer landing policy owns any explicit exception
for a PR-caused error with an immediate follow-up fix. The failed job remains visible in
Actions even when the aggregate accepts its main-owned assertion.

Repeated head SHAs are duplicate candidates, not reusable validation: the PR
merge tree may have changed. Per-PR concurrency coalesces pending work and cancels
superseded work; CI does not turn a previous head-only success into skipped tests
on a different merge tree.

To retranslate every Control UI or native app string, dispatch **Control UI Locale Refresh** or **Native App Locale Refresh** from `main` with `full_refresh=true`. Ordinary runs remain incremental. Both workflows read the primary and fallback models from the `OPENCLAW_I18N_MODEL` and `OPENCLAW_I18N_FALLBACK_MODEL` GitHub secrets, using the existing translation OpenAI API key. Only an explicit `model_not_found` provider error selects the fallback; authentication, quota, and network failures do not. Generated metadata and public diagnostics omit model identifiers.

The merge coordinator may reuse an authenticated successful `openclaw/ci-gate`
for the same pull-request head for up to 24 hours. This avoids rewriting a
contributor branch after unrelated `main` changes. The reusable result does not
replace the separate strict, App-owned test-merge check against current `main`.
A later pending or failed rerun does not erase an earlier successful result for
that unchanged head during the freshness window.
Reusing a CI check does not replace the current security review commit status.

The default-branch ruleset requires the GitHub Actions-owned `openclaw/ci-gate`
context. Repository maintainers and admins retain their CI bypass, including
for missing command approvals. Normal pull-request merges use the gate. The
separate code-owner ruleset requires a PR and the applicable owner approval even
when CI is bypassed; organization rules still block deletion and non-fast-forward
updates. The separate strict App-owned test-merge check still binds the head to
current `main`.

GitHub may mark superseded pull-request jobs as `cancelled` when a newer head lands. Treat that as CI noise unless the newest run for the same PR is also failing. Canonical `main` runs are not canceled after admission; each of the two parity slots replaces only its older pending run with the newest tip. Main and manual matrices use `fail-fast: false`, and `build-artifacts` reports embedded channel, core-support-boundary, and gateway-watch failures directly instead of queuing tiny verifier jobs. The canonical-main CI concurrency key is versioned (`CI-v8-*`) so GitHub-side zombies in the old group cannot block the two-slot pipeline; runnable PR groups remain on `CI-v7-*`, while passive draft runs use `CI-draft-v1-*`. Manual full-suite runs use `CI-manual-v1-*` and do not cancel in-progress runs. The plugin-list startup-memory guard keeps a 400 MiB ceiling on self-hosted Blacksmith Linux and allows 425 MiB on GitHub-hosted Linux, whose RSS baseline is higher for the same built CLI. The startup-memory check finishes alone before other built-artifact checks start on every runner, so concurrent verifiers do not perturb the RSS measurement.

The Testbox validation, native Periphery, OpenGrep PR Diff, Sandbox Common Smoke,
and Plugin Init Scaffold Validation workflows isolate passive draft PR events
(`opened`, `reopened`, and `synchronize`) from useful PR work at concurrency
admission. A delayed draft payload therefore cannot cancel an active ready run or
replace a pending one before the draft job or scan is skipped. Disabling
`cancel-in-progress` alone would still replace pending work. Where subscribed,
`converted_to_draft` stays in the ordinary PR group to intentionally cancel work;
non-draft head supersession and each workflow's existing manual/push grouping
remain unchanged. Periphery report publication separately checks source intent
and live PR state; see [Scope and routing](/ci/scope-and-routing).

The singleton smoke then rebuilds the runtime plugin overlay before any other verifier reads it. On Blacksmith, Gateway watch finishes its build-receipt writes and whole-tree measurement next; Doctor, SQLite lifecycle, channel, core-support-boundary, and Discord attachment checks can then overlap. Hosted 4-core runners keep their existing serial sequence and channel/core pair. TUI canaries run after all other verifiers finish. Every verifier owns a separate Vitest module cache, and each selected result remains part of the same failure aggregation. The wave step is unconditional because its startup and singleton checks always run; individual checks retain their selection gates. The artifact job consumes only its selected checkout, so base-commit fetching stays with jobs that actually compare revisions.

Use `pnpm ci:timings`, `pnpm ci:timings:recent`, or `node scripts/ci-run-timings.mjs <run-id>` to summarize wall time, start delay, slowest jobs, and failures from GitHub Actions. Use `pnpm ci:timings:trend` for a 72-hour baseline and a latest-12-hours versus prior-12-hours comparison. Trend mode includes every main push outcome, cancellation/pass rates, and successful-run wall time, then loads a balanced latest/prior sample of at most 100 successful runs by default. Its detailed sample separates workflow admission, job dependency/gate delay (`job.created_at` minus the first job's creation), runner queue/start latency (`job.started_at` minus `job.created_at`), and execution; it also reports critical-path ownership and the actual GitHub API request count. Reruns use attempt-specific jobs and are excluded from run-level wall/admission distributions because GitHub retains the original workflow creation time. Raise or lower the detailed-run selection cap with `--detail-runs` (a run with more than 100 jobs requires multiple requests), emit JSON to stdout with `--json`, or save the same report with `--output .artifacts/ci-timings/trend.json`; missing output directories are created automatically. The baseline must cover at least two comparison windows.

Run the timing helper locally; there is no in-workflow timing-summary job (a permanently disabled one was removed once the local helper became the tool everyone actually used). For build timing, check the `build-artifacts` job's `Build dist` step: `pnpm build:ci-artifacts` prints `[build-all] phase timings:` and includes `ui:build`; the job also uploads the `startup-memory` artifact.

The `Run Node test shard` step prints Bash `time -p` totals: elapsed (`real`), user CPU (`user`), and system CPU (`sys`) seconds, including waited-for child processes. Compare CPU totals with elapsed time across equivalent runs to distinguish extra CPU work from slower execution with similar CPU work. These totals alone do not establish runner contention.

Android test rows retain their existing Gradle JUnit XML for 14 days in
`android-test-reports-<task>-<checkout-revision>-<run-attempt>` artifacts, including
failed runs unless canceled. Reports identify test cases and durations; compilation,
lint, setup, and queue time remain separate in the job log. Read the XML alongside
that attempt's Gradle task outcomes: reports restored by `FROM-CACHE` or reused by
`UP-TO-DATE` describe an earlier execution, so their times are historical. They do
not show fresh test execution or a speedup in the current run. A failure before
Gradle writes XML can leave no artifact; the upload warns without replacing the
original failure. The artifact contains only phone and Wear unit-test XML, not
dependency caches or application build outputs.

Node test shards that need a built CLI run `pnpm build qaRuntime` before starting
Vitest. This profile builds runtime JavaScript, plugin assets, and freshness and
provenance metadata. Private QA shards select their private runtime entries. The
`build-artifacts` job owns Control UI and SDK declaration validation; release
package builds still generate the full declarations.

Source-only Linux Node 24 shards can restore compiled Vitest workers from the
protected cache warmer. The warmer prepares one generation before SDK or runtime
builds change package resolution, joins the preparation owner, and publishes only
the retained cache. PR jobs restore it without publishing. Consumers enable
reuse only when an archive exists; cold runners keep ordinary fresh compilation.
The worker owner verifies source and dependency bytes, compiler identity,
resolution topology, environment, output inventory, and the exact checkout and
output-slot paths before lending a generation. Changed or incompatible inputs
rebuild locally. Frozen targets, other Node versions, and runtime-building shards
retain fresh preparation.

The artifact job keeps its built outputs for its own smoke and boundary checks.
It no longer packs or uploads the unused `dist-runtime-build` and
`bundled-plugin-assets` archives. Runtime shards still start after preflight;
they do not wait for SDK declarations, the Control UI build, or artifact checks.
Diagnostic and proof uploads remain available.

Hosted Linux SDK declarations are published by the existing full main lint stripe 1,
after lint succeeds. Hybrid uses its plugin-lint row; the GitHub profile uses its
core row that also checks plugin stripe 1. Both use the workflow's pinned Node
runtime and preserve the restore archive's path contract for the prepared SDK
and its validated receipt. The warmer keeps
its other caches and non-hosted SDK ownership, avoiding a second hosted SDK emit.
PRs remain restore-only, and semantic source/toolchain/output checks still run.

Completed canonical-main extension boundary jobs publish their existing compiler
receipts into a cache separated by OS, architecture, and runner environment. PRs
restore that archive, falling back to the SDK warmer's declaration-only archive.
Every restored receipt still validates its compiler, configuration, source,
resolution lookups, and output hashes; the negative boundary canary always runs.
Receipts include missing candidates, directory listings, and symlink resolutions,
so an unrelated new test can retain a hit while a newly effective type dependency
invalidates it. Each validation snapshot shares actual check results across
receipts, while comparing every recorded fact. Fresh compiles still seal the
whole resolution namespace against changes during compilation. Old or malformed
receipts recompile. This adds no producer job or package-selection exemption.

Declaration caches hash the selected writer's transitive generator imports,
package and plugin metadata, explicit schema and build metadata inputs, and
the compiler's recorded source files. Editing an unrelated CI script does not
rebuild declarations. Resolution topology still participates in the cache key,
and an unresolved generator import stops the build instead of trusting a cache.

Local `pnpm build:ci-artifacts` uses the same memory admission as full and package
builds. The orchestrator passes the resolved heap budget to every child process,
including the SDK declaration writer, so local builds do not depend on CI's
`NODE_OPTIONS` setting. The existing policy accounts for host and cgroup limits
and reserves native-memory headroom. If the default budget cannot fit the build,
it stops before build steps or cache restoration; `OPENCLAW_TSDOWN_MAX_OLD_SPACE_MB`
remains the explicit operator override for attempting a different budget.

## Control UI size budgets

`pnpm ui:build` produces and verifies the bundle, then reports its compressed
sizes. Budget violations do not prevent artifact generation. The separate
`control-ui-performance` job enforces the budgets without blocking other jobs
from building or testing the same source.

The report counts retained identity bytes: asset-manifest entries minus `.br`/`.gz`
sidecars, which the Gateway keeps for already-open tabs after an update. The limit
is 48 MiB, half the 96 MiB retention budget in
`src/gateway/control-ui-asset-manifest.ts`, so the current and previous builds
stay retained. Like the other size limits, it fails locally and warns in GitHub
Actions; `--base-dist` reports the delta. Exceeding it means shrinking retained
assets (locale catalogs are the largest share) or deliberately changing the
retention budget.

Startup CSS has a 45 KiB advisory target and a 50 KiB hard ceiling. Growth below
1 KiB passes; an increase of 1 KiB or more in either startup CSS or the largest
CSS file fails the comparison. The existing largest-file, JavaScript, request-count,
and isolated-renderer ceilings still apply independently. Reports include exact
bytes, base deltas, and remaining headroom, with an early warning when the largest
CSS file has less than 1 KiB of headroom.

JavaScript accounting separates ordinary chunks, deferred special-purpose
chunks, startup assets, and the full bundle total. The 215 KiB ordinary-chunk
ceiling excludes the isolated Mermaid renderer and configured locale catalogs.
A locale catalog must match `assets/<locale>-<nonempty-suffix>.js`; each
configured locale may produce one deferred chunk, with at most 20 locale chunks
overall and a 300 KiB ceiling per chunk. Locale chunks remain forbidden in the
startup asset set. Total JavaScript accounting includes ordinary, deferred, and
startup assets for reporting while enforcement stays on the category-specific
limits.

CI builds the selected checkout and the exact preflight base with the same
installed Node, Vite, and dependencies. The temporary base's CSS sidecars are
normalized through the candidate's pinned compressor before comparison. The
report identifies both revisions and the toolchain. There is no manually updated
CSS baseline, and the cumulative ceilings still bound a series of small changes.

Run the same comparison locally after installing dependencies:

```bash
pnpm ui:check-performance:base <base-commit-sha>
```

To enforce absolute budgets on an existing build, run `pnpm ui:check-performance`.
Use `--base-dist <directory>` to compare with an already-built base, or
`--report-only` to report violations without failing. Missing or malformed build
artifacts remain errors in report-only mode.

With no observed failures, the PR failure monitor exits when the only remaining
workload cannot qualify for a known-main-red exception. The aggregate still waits
for and validates that workload. Eligible final workloads remain observed so a
late inherited failure can receive complete classification evidence.
