## Runner registration budget

OpenClaw's current GitHub runner-registration bucket reports 10,000 self-hosted
runner registrations per 5 minutes in `gh api rate_limit`. Re-check
`actions_runner_registration` before each tuning pass because GitHub can change
this bucket. The limit is shared by all Blacksmith runner registrations in the
`openclaw` organization, so adding another Blacksmith installation does not add
a new bucket.

Treat Blacksmith labels as the scarce resource for burst control. Jobs that
only route, notify, summarize, select shards, or run short CodeQL scans should
stay on GitHub-hosted runners unless they have measured Blacksmith-specific
needs. Any new Blacksmith matrix, larger `max-parallel`, or high-frequency
workflow must show its worst-case registration count and keep the org-level
target below about 60% of the live bucket. With the current 10,000-registration
bucket, that means a 6,000-registration operating target, leaving headroom for
concurrent repositories, retries, and burst overlap.

Trusted automatic hybrid first-attempt preflight jobs request the existing
16-class after three nearby hosted preflights remained unassigned while their
Blacksmith security jobs completed. Each eligible hybrid run admits one
Blacksmith preflight plus security when optional hosted admission is closed,
for at most two control registrations; default Blacksmith retains one. Both jobs already
belong to the conservative 80 non-Node allowance, so the retained
`4 × 144 + 21 × 200 = 4,776` ceiling is unchanged. The exposed live bucket still
reported 10,000 on 2026-09-16; its pooled reader's unused quota does not establish
organization-wide free capacity. The remaining 1,224 allowance must still cover
adjacent repositories, releases, retries and carryover. This routing trial does
not prove available physical capacity or faster preflight execution.

The protected cache warmer has two platform rows: the existing Linux workload and one hosted macOS pnpm-store publisher. Its per-ref concurrency and pending-run coalescing are unchanged. Each admitted warmer run adds one hosted macOS job and no Blacksmith registrations; pull-request CI adds no writers or jobs. Native producer and consumer measurements must include cache transfer, extraction, installation, and archive size before claiming a setup-time saving.

The published-upgrade PR/main tripwire reuses the reserved `docker-seed-e2e` job,
so the retained peak envelope stays `4 × 144 + 21 × 200 = 4,776` registrations.
Docs-only main tips remain excluded by the `**/*.md` and `docs/**` push filters.
Admitted main pushes retain the same two non-canceling parity slots; the bound
includes both active runs and both coalesced successors. It does not assume
that every pushed commit starts a run.
The weekly Update Migration dispatch uses one targeted Docker group per
supported baseline for native operator state and keeps synthetic cleanup on
the candidate-relative predecessor. If that predecessor is outside the
supported set, it adds one existing matrix row: at most five targeted jobs,
plus image preparation, the group planner, and the hybrid ref validator, for
at most eight Blacksmith registrations per weekly run. Its separate non-canceling concurrency group
coalesces pending scheduled runs and cannot cancel manual validation. Release
checks reuse the same bounded grouping and unchanged 32-job cap: at four
distinct baselines, normal Package Acceptance selects 16 targeted jobs (17
when the predecessor needs its own row) and release soak selects 20. The
three-scenario group limit and 32-job concurrency cap are unchanged. The additional weekly burst and expanded release jobs
share the existing headroom for releases, adjacent repositories, and carryover;
the live shared bucket must still be checked before further fanout changes.

The three Mac Node parts add two hosted jobs per run on `github` and `hybrid`, with no added Blacksmith registrations there. Normal Blacksmith routing adds two registrations per qualifying attempt-1 push or trusted PR; manual runs, retries, and untrusted PRs remain hosted. The matrix concurrency cap is three. GitHub's documented Enterprise macOS concurrency allowance is 50, shared with other hosted Mac workflows; it does not guarantee immediate runner admission. No runner class or repository capacity setting changes with this split.

`Release npm Cache Warm` (`release-npm-cache-warm.yml`) runs a hosted Linux job on scheduled and manual triggers to prepare an npm download seed from the latest published OpenClaw package with lifecycle scripts disabled. Its concurrency group is separate from push-triggered Vitest warming, so newer pushes cannot cancel a pending seed. Scheduled runs publish from `main`, so new release branches can restore that seed through GitHub's default-branch cache scope. Each seed starts empty and contains only the current baseline dependency graph. Cross-OS release checks first restore their candidate-specific cache, then a matching runtime/suite cache, then this shared seed. Only npm's content-addressed `_cacache` directory is archived; install prefixes, OpenClaw state, npm logs, and executable `npx` caches remain fresh. The producer and consumers use the same relative archive path and enable cross-OS archives. npm retains normal freshness and integrity checks and downloads missing platform-specific packages. This adds one hosted Linux job per scheduled or manual warmer run, no jobs on pushes, and no Blacksmith registrations.

Small precise PR changes use a focused Node plan. Broad, deleted or unknown changes retain compact core plus the affected plugin fallback; canonical pushes use the integration compact. Every compact planner profile is capped at 80 rows, and plugin fallback packing is capped at 50. The final canonical Node matrix also enforces 64 push rows or 120 PR rows, including precise plans. Missing changed paths, missing current planner capabilities and planner errors fail preflight instead of emitting an incomplete successful matrix. Approved historical dispatches retain their full named plans. Count every emitted matrix row and nonmatrix job, including all six Android rows despite its two-job concurrency cap.

The shared plugin catch-all, QA and provider suites use native Vitest sharding, sized from the existing 90-file envelope budget. Their complete configs still own discovery and exclusions; the counting inventory never narrows execution to the directly changed plugin. At `2f7fb353`, the catch-all has 486 counting entries and 474 effective files across six jobs, QA has 238/232 across three, and providers have 275/256 across four. Counting entries include files excluded by Vitest, so the budget is conservative. Each job retains its existing worker limits, isolation policy and per-file module cleanup.

Process-bounded plugin fallback uses each test file's effective config owner,
including files migrated from ordinary plugin suites to database workers.
Broad fallback retains the complete selected config inventory, including
built-in plugins without package manifests; plugin-only changes keep their scope.
Even a single bounded envelope retains its explicit file scope, so it cannot
silently execute the larger whole config. Uneven bounded chunks use their own
file counts with the existing cost rates; native Vitest shards retain equal
shares of the complete config estimate.

Native database-worker roots share a 20-file CI job ceiling, including every
co-located envelope. The existing root registry owns classification; migrated
files retain their original plugin's job and process limits. This partitions the
185-file native envelope from [run 35176277297](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/35176277297)
into ten non-overlapping envelopes. That run continued passing tests for more
than 58 minutes before the job deadline; it is a lower bound, not a completed
family timing sample. The ceiling prevents the default cost estimate from
packing the chunks back together. Fork isolation, process lifetimes, worker
limits, timeouts, and the 50-job fallback cap stay unchanged. Hosted CI must
establish the resulting job durations.

Precise and fallback plugin envelopes share the same packing owner and a 240-second aggregate estimated budget per job, including multiple envelopes of the same config. Members retain compatible runner/dist requirements and run one at a time; total cost bounds packing rather than a pair limit. Each envelope retains its original child process, environment, native shard arguments and include scope, including process-bounded Codex, Matrix and Telegram work. Runtime-preparing envelopes remain separate. Co-location preserves each original file/process bound and native shard partition; a physical job may contain several such envelopes. Workers, timeouts and serial stop-on-failure behavior stay unchanged. Costs retain the larger complete-family rate from [run 33676780376](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33676780376) and [run 33747183683](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33747183683), rounded up per counting file without lowering prior floors. Both cohorts used two CPUs and two workers; counting inputs include the config-owned exclusions, and runtime preparation is charged separately. Repacking the retained 78 envelopes with these rates projects 30 jobs instead of 32. The largest sum of matching observed child spans is 340.128 seconds. This is a forecast across different source revisions, not measured combined-job latency; native CI must verify elapsed time and cleanup within the eight-minute end-to-end objective.

Eligible Blacksmith and hybrid compact bins with multiple ordinary groups retain their logical packing class and request the existing 32-vCPU runner with two child-process slots. They admit 360 predicted aggregate seconds; compatible small groups can fill that budget without the ten-group cutoff retained by serial jobs. Initial packing separates runtime consumers from groups that need no build; the measured hybrid placement pass below can use spare ordinary capacity. Blacksmith serial jobs retain their 200/276-second budgets; hybrid serial jobs retain 210 seconds. Exclusive jobs retain 150 seconds by default. Only complete ordinary hybrid bins of non-build CLI groups may use 250 seconds and share split siblings; every child must still fit 150 seconds. Groups above their existing serial cap stay alone. Exclusive groups, single groups, dist descriptors and jobs with runtime preparation remain serial. Hybrid exclusive and dist bins retain their existing prerequisite sharing. The shard executor admits at most two processes only when the actual host has at least eight available CPUs and 24 GiB of memory; smaller capacity admits one. Each overlapping child keeps two Vitest workers, inner project parallelism remains one, and commands retain their serial file policy. The primary `github` profile stays serial at 210 seconds. Preflight records the actual row count for each source revision; canonical inventory comparisons must preserve every original child plan and test input. Native elapsed-time, memory and cleanup evidence must establish the actual effect.

The `github` compact planner can place smaller ordinary groups on an already-required stronger logical runner. Each emitted job retains its strongest capacity owner, serial execution, original child processes and worker limits, the 210-second budget, and the ten-group limit. SDK and plugin runtime consumers are separated from ordinary files before packing; the SDK light project intersects shared include lists with its own inventory. Parent-derived fractional costs are rounded only at the emitted job boundary, so rounding small consumers cannot create a redundant runtime build. The shared packer can exchange groups to fill compatible capacity while rechecking complete replacements. Runtime-only hosted groups may share their strongest prerequisite within the existing 210-second serial budget; the build itself costs 160–166 seconds and is charged once per job. No-build exclusive groups keep their 150-second limit. Stranded tooling tails are sized against remaining compatible capacity before normal admission is reapplied. Exclusive, dist, oversized, and runtime-preparing bins retain their separate constraints.

The September 16 capacity repair removes the blanket post-packing 32-to-16 downgrade and the three named compact 32-to-16 overrides. On the inspected inventory, 18 existing hybrid jobs per push or broad PR return to the 32-class; the Blacksmith profile restores 19 push or 36 broad-PR placements, including agent-support and tooling. This changes zero total runner registrations and adds no hosted rows, so the conservative 4,776-registration envelope remains unchanged. Restoring real-Gateway E2E adds one 32-class assignment when that job is selected, for 19 hybrid assignments in total on this inventory, still with zero additional registrations. Other workflow sizing remains in place. These counts depend on the inventory; verify the emitted plan and actual eight-CPU/24-GiB admission before claiming a wall-time improvement.

Failed-job-only hybrid retries retain their original matrix and its 360-second aggregate estimates when routing to hosted Ubuntu. They do not repack to 210 seconds. The existing capacity gate reduces concurrency to one on those hosts, while the retained two-slot descriptor keeps the two-worker child budget. Such retries can exceed the eight-minute normal-run objective; existing 60/120-minute job deadlines and watchdogs are unchanged. Requested runner labels do not establish actual CPU or memory capacity.

The final Node matrix admits longer estimated jobs first across compact and plugin descriptors. Plugin estimates reuse the extension batch cost owner, including existing process boundaries; runtime preparation is charged separately from the same prerequisite table used by compact jobs. Equal estimates and historical descriptors without estimates keep their original order. The 96-job concurrency ceiling bounds active jobs, while the manifest caps bound total admissions. In run `33449014227`, all 96 slots were occupied when the late QA job started; that dependency delay was matrix admission, not evidence of runner-registration throttling.

Expanded serial large/small jobs admit 210 predicted seconds; eligible hybrid parallel bins admit 360. All profiles retain the shared 80-row compact cap. The 150-second file-split and default exclusive-group budgets stay unchanged; complete non-build CLI bins alone may use the 250-second ordinary hybrid admission budget. The PR-only performance lifecycle file retains its 136-second fallback from native spans of 127.288/135.808 seconds in runs 33532741896/33545657559; canonical pushes omit that tooling family. Trusted contributor forks can use the GitHub profile on Blacksmith, so every profile participates in the same registration bound. The widest current workflow profiles retain up to 86 other potential rows (14 nonmatrix and 72 matrix), or 87 for historical targets without the UI named-project contract. The conservative cap-based envelope already includes twelve Control UI shards plus the browser-extension row on every profile. Excluding the four unconditionally hosted iOS rows, two hosted macOS Swift phases, and the hosted aggregate gate gives the conservative ceiling of 80 potentially eligible rows. This includes the new Control UI performance job; keep the ceiling rather than spending savings from consolidated checks. With the final Node caps, the bounds are 144 registrations per main run and 200 per PR. Two active main slots, both pending successors and the observed peak of 21 non-skipped PR arrivals give `4 × 144 + 21 × 200 = 4,776` registrations in five minutes. This leaves 1,224 within the 6,000 reference operating target for release work, adjacent repositories and carryover; it does not prove those arrivals fit. The earlier 19-arrival estimate is obsolete. Using the prior 4,826-registration reference, the bounded 2026-09-02 cohort audit counted 321 unassigned Blacksmith jobs and reserved nine auxiliary rows, giving `4,826 + 321 + 9 = 5,156` planned registrations and an 844-row allowance below that reference. Its 40 exact attempts covered 4,830 jobs; queued observations spanned 21:50:48–21:57:11 UTC and were not simultaneous. Already-assigned jobs, old approval-waiting runs, unobserved retries and unlisted organization work remain outside that cohort, so this is a conditional planning bound rather than a live organization balance. Evaluate a single PR trial using its actual emitted rows separately from the rollout model. Budget all six npm qualification jobs and the relevant full-release children; a shared-token quota response or unused bucket does not establish organization-wide usage or physical runner capacity.

`checks-ui-e2e` emits thirteen rows for every newly planned target with the named-project contract: twelve combined weighted Control UI shards and one browser-extension row. This width applies across backend profiles, attempts, frozen targets, and missing attempt metadata. Control UI shards use the 16-class; the browser row uses the 8-class unless admitted to hosted Ubuntu by the bounded hybrid plan. Historical targets without the contract retain four total rows on the Blacksmith planner profile or fourteen on GitHub and hybrid profiles. The 2026-09-02 inventory at `49fb9c5` contains 359 files: 329 parallel bundle consumers, three parallel self-owned files, seven serial bundle consumers, and 20 serial private source/custom-build files. Ordinary CI excludes seven real-Gateway files, leaving 352. Four native projects represent resource ownership without adding jobs or execution phases: `ui-e2e-bundled` and `ui-e2e-standalone` share group 0 with at most two workers total, then `ui-e2e-serial` and `ui-e2e-serial-standalone` share group 1 with one worker. Local throttling and explicit worker limits still apply. The shared weighted sequencer charges each file by its measured duration divided by that project's effective worker count and assigns every discovered specification once across the selected Control UI rows. The root config keeps the complete inventory visible for discovery. Serial scheduling still protects private source servers that share a Vite optimizer cache, real Gateways, and the runtime-budget measurement; test cases, deadlines, and isolation are unchanged.

Every selected project discovers Chromium. The first selected bundle-consuming project builds one private production bundle/preview and publishes its URL through Vitest's invocation-scoped root context; later consumers share it until invocation teardown. Standalone projects have no bundle setup or URL bridge, so standalone-only selections skip that build. Enabled manual proof capture uses the shared upload directory, including the MCP and Logs suites.

Ordinary and real-Gateway Control UI jobs upload only allowlisted `failure.public.json` summaries and retain them for seven days, with separate artifact paths for each job and run attempt. Raw `failure.private.json` reports and `failure.private.png` screenshots remain local and are excluded from these uploads. Older frozen targets without the public summary produce no matching upload; raw captures are never a fallback.

The dedicated real-Gateway job runs its complete selected inventory in one invocation through `test/vitest/vitest.ui-e2e-prebuilt.config.ts`. It requires a clean checkout and completed runtime, private QA, and canonical Control UI artifacts from `OPENCLAW_BUILD_PRIVATE_QA=1 pnpm build:ci-artifacts`. Source and built outputs must remain unchanged until all workers and children finish. A readiness failure stops the invocation without rebuilding or falling back to another config. Files outside the prebuilt config’s shared-reader/writer allowlist run serially first; audited fixtures with private HOME, state, ports, and cleanup then share the existing two-worker limit. The allowlist admits both invocation-preview consumers and fixtures serving canonical built UI bytes through their own prepared Gateway child. The invocation preview builds its own private output from the same source. This adds no CI jobs or shards. The ordinary local config keeps real-Gateway files serial, and frozen targets lacking the prebuilt config retain their original serial command.

The original two-worker rollout had a controlled Linux comparison covering its then-complete inventory of 14 files and 25 tests, reducing invocation elapsed time from 309.374 to 202.027 seconds. Those historical results do not measure later allowlist additions, complete CI timing, or achievement of the CI latency target.

Eligible `control-ui` rows request `blacksmith-16vcpu-ubuntu-2404`; the browser-extension row keeps the 8-vCPU request when optional hosted admission is closed, and eligible real-Gateway jobs request the 32-class. Backend, event, contributor-trust and cache-write boundaries are unchanged, including hybrid first attempts and trusted contributor forks. Historical [run 33692146223](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33692146223) had two slowest UI rows requesting the 8-vCPU label but reporting two CPUs; their 356/383-second test steps set the 8:20 non-Windows wall. That run's 32-vCPU jobs reported eight CPUs. The larger request added no workers. In historical [run 33695337496](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33695337496), all twelve UI rows on the 32-class reported eight CPUs and finished by 4:38 from workflow creation, with 102–145-second test steps. Those measurements do not establish timings on today's 16-class route. Stale file weights still need the existing refit's independent-run and replacement thresholds, rather than a one-run manual adjustment.

In [run 35028248954, UI job 6/7](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/35028248954/job/104582299257), the six-shard Control UI plan requested the 16-class and reported four CPUs. Setup took about 3m45s before the test command. The job recorded 168 passing tests and three failures before cancellation about 25m07s after runner startup; a test completed three seconds before cancellation. The twelve-shard plan still needs native CI timing proof, and widening the plan does not resolve those assertions or guarantee completion within the unchanged deadline.

The real-Gateway placement restores the 32-class request, adding zero jobs or registrations. The 16-class delivered four CPUs and canceled a progressing suite at 1,227 seconds in [run 35120538555](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/35120538555/job/104877350907). The Blacksmith job budget remains 20 minutes, hosted remains 40, and all test deadlines stay fixed. Its private artifact build may overlap exactly two canonical SDK cache misses only with at least two available CPUs and 25.5 GiB of observed remaining memory for both unchanged 12-GiB heaps and 768 MiB of native headroom each. Unknown finite-cgroup usage, smaller capacity, cache hits, or a single nonempty miss retain serial compilation. Runtime and UI publication still complete before browser readers start; browser worker limits, file inventory, and deadlines are unchanged. Standalone compiler measurements are not complete CI timings, so the full job must be validated on the selected native CI route.

The browser-extension row prepares only its native-host runtime JavaScript and assets through the existing `qaRuntime` build profile rather than rebuilding declarations and the Control UI. The thirteen-row named-project plan stays inside the existing conservative registration bound. A failed-job-only retry retains its previously emitted matrix, including older plans with six Control UI shards. PR retries and hybrid push retries select hosted Ubuntu through live routing, so they may take longer; the existing 25-minute timeout is unchanged. Rerunning preflight for a target with the named-project contract selects twelve Control UI shards plus the browser-extension row. Canonical push retries on the Blacksmith profile retain Blacksmith routing. The `max-parallel` ceiling stays 14 for historical targets without the named-project contract, which retain their previous width. Physical capacity must be checked separately from the registration bound.

The previous thirteen-serial-shard layout consumed 4,258 job-seconds in successful [run 33494931388](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33494931388) on 2026-09-01, averaging 327.5 seconds per Control UI row; preflight added 39 seconds and the tail row took 363 seconds. The current projects reduce the modeled body through bounded bundled concurrency. In run `33638745824`, twelve successful first-attempt Control UI rows had median/p90 test steps of 197/235 seconds, while their checkout median reached 116.5 seconds. Reducing thirteen Control UI shards to twelve removes one repeated checkout and setup without combining the separate browser-extension work. The current target is eight minutes for normal non-Windows CI, with fewer jobs preferred over a tighter latency target. Measure queueing, checkout, setup and test work separately; the final gate still waits for Windows, which may exceed that target. The historical serial layout and the single hosted retry are not paired performance comparisons.

Canonical-repo CI keeps Blacksmith as the default runner path for pushes and first-attempt same-repo pull-request runs when the backend is unset or `blacksmith`. Hybrid keeps the heavy set plus the named critical-path plateau lanes on Blacksmith for attempt 1; other light lanes and every rerun Blacksmith lane use GitHub-hosted capacity. Pull-request retries of both UI E2E jobs use GitHub-hosted Ubuntu in every mode; push retries remain on their normal backend unless hybrid fallback applies. Manual `workflow_dispatch` and non-canonical repository runs use GitHub-hosted runners for the main test/build lanes. With an unset or `blacksmith` backend, ordinary canonical manual dispatches (`release_gate: false`) can still run the seven `check-shard` rows on their Blacksmith matrix runners; release-gate check rows remain hosted. Same-repo hybrid Full Release Validation sends only frozen-candidate lint to its matrix runner, both for exact main-ancestor SHAs without a release context and for canonical release-context candidates. These manual admissions are outside the main/PR arrival estimate above. The [`github` backend](/ci/runners#runner-backend-modes) provides a manual repository-wide fallback; canonical runs do not probe Blacksmith queue health or mutate the variable automatically.

## Owner-path and release coverage

Docker seed and QA Smoke use the same owner-path gates on canonical PRs and
`main`. Unrelated main changes can omit one 16-class Docker job and four 16-class
QA profile jobs on a normal hybrid first attempt. Control UI performance uses
its own UI/build/dependency/import scope; in hybrid it already runs hosted, so
narrowing its scope removes a hosted row and candidate/base UI builds.

The 2026-09-16 burden analysis estimated about 1,526 Blacksmith vCPU-minutes per
hour from Docker and QA gating, using the sampled workload and head-commit diff
proxies. Its 20 Docker and 80 QA main jobs had no failures; that small sample
does not establish that the lanes cannot catch integration regressions.
These are projected savings, with no measured post-change timing improvement.
Production routing uses the triggering push's changed-path manifest; it does not
accumulate earlier pushes whose pending runs were coalesced away.

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docker seed            | Existing seed owners; unknown paths retain survivor                                          | Canonical CI retains `legacy-operator-state` with `auto-auth`; Package Acceptance retains expanded upgrade scenarios |
| QA Smoke CI            | Existing QA, channel, packaging, and orchestration owners                                    | Complete smoke profile on supported targets                                                                          |
| Control UI performance | UI, plugin browser, workspace-package, build, dependency, policy, and relative-import owners | Retained independently of changed paths, subject to existing target capabilities                                     |

Per-main integration detection outside these owners moves to manual/release
validation. Keep the conservative peak registration envelope above: a broad owner
change can still select every lane. This scope change does not change runner
backends, caps, budgets, or timeouts. Verify emitted rows and observed timing
before claiming realized savings.

## Measured shard weights

Gateway core, database-worker, methods, methods-isolated, server, and
server-isolated configs run with exclusive plan admission. Cold in-process
Gateway boot measured 37 seconds alone and 50 seconds under contention against
a 90-second test budget. Jobs containing these configs execute their packed
plans serially. Existing bins, summed duration budgets, runner allocations,
file partitions, and timing keys stay unchanged; formerly parallel jobs retain
their two-worker ceiling through the job environment. This adds no jobs and
leaves ordinary jobs' concurrency unchanged. The shard runner enforces the same
config policy even when a caller requests two plans. Precise changed-test
selection retains the Gateway config owner and its admission metadata.

Complete hybrid main and pull-request plans retain their existing jobs and runner
allocations while admitting measured runtime groups within 440 seconds, including
the existing 100-second build allowance. This reserves 40 seconds of the
eight-minute objective for checkout/setup; it does not change test deadlines or
guarantee elapsed time. Only non-exclusive jobs without dist or private-QA
preparation participate. A whole runtime group can move to an already-required
equal-or-stronger runner only with its own explicit worker limit.

The recipient can already prepare a runtime or have spare ordinary capacity. An
ordinary recipient becomes serial and prepares one runtime; its previously
parallel groups retain their two-worker allowance through explicit pins. Their
prepared timing identities remain unchanged, preserving complete parent
generations. The CI executor applies the smaller of the supplied
job ceiling and group cap. When transfers have the same maximum estimate, the
planner prefers the recipient with more remaining time. This can add a runtime
build while reducing requested process concurrency, without adding a job or
runner registration. Count that preparation cost when verifying the result.

Both replacement bins must pass the shared family, group-count and budget
checks. If no transfer fits, CI retains the complete existing plan and reports
its over-budget estimate; an optimization cannot suppress test coverage.
Recipient capacity must preserve the donor job's fixed runner anchor, including
any earlier promotion of that group. Exclusive, private-QA, dist and hosted
policies remain unchanged. Precise changed-file plans retain their original
placement templates and admission floors.

The refit stores typed runtime-placement observations from the emitted group
descriptor, successful complete envelope and runtime-readiness marker. Configs,
group environment, complete file membership and prebuild mode accompany each
measurement. An exact matching observation takes precedence. When it is absent,
the largest compatible observation whose files are all still present supplies an
advisory floor. This retains known work after a file is added without summing
overlapping observations, borrowing another environment's cost, or interpreting
directory/glob selectors as complete files. A later exact measurement can lower
the estimate after an optimization.

These observations use the same independent-run sampling rules and apply only
after file splitting. They do not reconstruct a full parent or change the test
partition. Existing parent and exact-child timing keys retain their meaning.
Wrapper preparation is already included in each observation; the separate shared
runtime build is charged once per job. Unknown groups retain positive fallback
costs. Native evidence with the same inventory must verify latency, actual
resources and cleanup before claiming improvement.

`config/ci-test-timings.json` records CI measurements for UI and Gateway E2E files
and compact Node groups. UI and compact packers prefer these weights over their in-source cold-start
tables. UI E2E keys are repo-relative paths, including tests under `ui/src/pages/`,
and every file estimate includes the measured fork, import, and setup overhead.
Compact groups have separate Blacksmith and GitHub-hosted measurements, selected
from jobs API runner labels (`blacksmith-*` versus hosted `ubuntu-24.04`); hybrid
and large-group stripe adjustments continue to use their existing policies.
Compact weights use the complete `[shard:x] begin` to `end` span, preserving
process startup and any contention in the measured run. Ordinary Blacksmith compact jobs may execute two groups concurrently; serial
jobs retain `planConcurrency: 1`. The refit preserves each complete child span,
including contention, without subtracting setup or rewriting historical costs. Runner-profile
calibration remains a separate admission policy.

For split compact groups, the refit also records the parent cost from a complete
generation within one run and runner profile. It sums each part's median span,
takes the largest complete generation or direct parent measurement in that run,
and applies the same two-run minimum and median rules. The stable parent estimate
survives file additions and repartitioning, while exact child keys continue to
describe only their original inventory. Partial generations cannot create or
lower a parent estimate; observing a child preserves an existing parent during
pruning. Parts from different runs, profiles, or generations never form a total.

Gateway E2E uses the same greedy partition owner as UI E2E. Measured file durations
include suite hooks; new files use source bytes scaled by the discovered files'
measured seconds per byte. Without measurements, Gateway partitions use source
bytes alone. The CLI JSON suite is split by command family so its existing cases
can run across the four shards without an indivisible serial tail.

The compact plan is built once in preflight. E2E shards build their partitions
independently, so they must read the same committed file from the checkout. They
never download timing artifacts or consult restored timing caches. Missing or
invalid timing files, or `OPENCLAW_CI_TEST_TIMINGS=0`, use the cold-start estimates
for the entire file; stale keys cannot change the discovered test inventory.

With an authenticated `gh` CLI, run `pnpm ci:timings:refit` to regenerate the file.
Each invocation freezes one UTC upper bound and a lower bound seven days earlier.
Every run-list page uses both bounds. Returned run timestamps and successful job
timestamps outside that window fail validation.

The refit seeks up to five successful `ci.yml` push runs on `main` with parsed
compact measurements. Docs-only runs and unparseable logs do not fill that quota.
It also samples up to five successful manual runs of each release-check workflow
that owns Gateway E2E. Run searches remain bounded by 25 pages and GitHub's
1,000-result filtered-query limit. Incomplete pagination fails without writing.

For each selected run, the refit captures `run_attempt` and enumerates attempts
one through that value. It verifies each job's run ID, attempt and workflow SHA
before reading successful, completed jobs. This retains original successful jobs
when a partial retry runs only failed jobs. Duplicate run and job IDs do not add
samples. Ordinary manual CI dispatches remain excluded because their measured
target can differ from the workflow head. Release workflows validate their
selected target before tests. Their workflow SHA identifies tooling, not the
measured source.

Use `--runs <n>` to change the run quota, not the seven-day window.
Use `--repo <owner/repo>` to select a repository, `--out <path>` to write elsewhere,
or `--dry-run` to report changes without writing. The report separates main and
release observations, including run IDs, attempts, workflow SHAs, creation dates,
parsed profiles and timing-job counts.

For a scoped repair using already downloaded main-job logs, use the same
`refitTestTimings` reducer with verified successful job metadata and the current
timing file. Preserve independent run IDs and runner labels. Two contributing
runs refresh eligible keys without enabling the three-run pruning rule for
unobserved groups; do not substitute job totals or local timings for child spans.
Keep the input run IDs and replacement table in the PR. The September 16 CLI
refresh used successful jobs in runs `35042635751` and `35044335386`: complete
child spans of 569.841 and 620.791 seconds replace the stale 136-second weight
with a rounded median of 595 seconds. Plugin fallback costs have a separate
estimator and are not inputs to this compact timing reducer.

The September 16 compact refresh sampled all 168 successful compact jobs in six
green main runs: `35117379165`, `35120372547`, `35123270863`, `35124135571`,
`35125714752`, and `35126089717`. Their 132 complete selector generations contain
no partial parent totals. The unchanged reducer supplies every replacement and
removal, retaining its independent-run minimum, outlier filter and 15% threshold.
The scoped output applies only its Blacksmith compact map; UI, Gateway E2E,
runtime-placement observations and hosted measurements retain their prior values.

Storage/state parts 2 and 3 measured 735.136 and 623.723 seconds; Doctor
config/state part 2 measured 505.405 seconds. Existing selector splitting turns
the hybrid storage/state family from three parts into ten, Doctor config/state
from two into five, and runtime config from three into six. Their complete file
inventories, process isolation, worker limits, naming scheme and timing-key
generation remain owned by the existing planner. Repartitioned children receive
new membership keys; the measured parent survives that change. Blacksmith also
adds Gateway core-1 and core-2 to its existing split-owner list after their
complete measurements reached 578 and 491 seconds. Hybrid and hosted already
split those owners. Standalone agent support retains its existing whole-group
contract.

Blacksmith-profile PRs changing the compact planner or committed timing file run
the complete compact core plan: focused planner tests alone cannot measure the
resulting packing. Hosted profiles retain precise changed-test targeting. This
uses the existing matrices and caps; plugin fallback keeps its separate owner.

Three families retain their previous complete timing entries to avoid hosted expansion:
`agentic-gateway-server-isolated`, `agentic-gateway-core-runtime`, and
`agentic-agents-core-spawn-production-boundary`. Applying their Blacksmith refit
would expand the hosted fallback beyond its 80-row compact cap. No two independent
recent hosted samples were available to calibrate them. This scoped refresh
therefore defers those families rather than introducing extra hosted rows or
inventing hosted measurements. The unscoped refit and all observed overruns belong
in the PR evidence for a later capacity-aware refresh. The `agentic-cli-process`
family also retains its prior timings: distributing its new parent total by the
existing file weights prices an indivisible child at 239 seconds, beyond its
200-second contract. That family needs a separate file-cost refit; its assertions
and budget remain unchanged.

At the inspected inventory, hybrid compact descriptors change from 29 to 51 on
push and 53 to 75 on broad PRs; the maximum prediction remains 518 seconds for the
standalone CLI. Ordinary two-child bins remain within 360 seconds. Excluding dist,
the Node matrix uses 50 push rows and 113 broad-PR rows including 40 plugin rows,
within the unchanged 64/120 caps. Blacksmith compact descriptors change from
34/52 to 59/77; the honest 804-second maximum belongs to standalone agent support.
Hosted plans remain byte-identical at 51/79 descriptors. Hybrid adds 22/22
registrations per push/PR, or 550 across the retained four-main/21-PR arrival
envelope; these rows consume existing reserved capacity, so the enforced
4,776-registration ceiling does not increase. Budgets and timeouts are unchanged.

The samples predate the 17:33 UTC runner-capacity restoration. They retain the
older allocation's contention, so these predictions are not a measured speedup.
Verify the restored eight-CPU/two-child admission, longest compact jobs, total
wall time and emitted registration counts on the PR and first main run.

Fewer than two independent main compact contributors fails the invocation.
It also fails if neither a compact key nor a runtime-placement observation meets the existing independent-run sampling rules.
Retained baseline weights and release measurements cannot satisfy these checks.
Both failures leave the timing file unchanged.
Measurements come only from successful UI E2E, Gateway E2E, and compact jobs; compact groups
also require an `exit 0` marker. Each entry needs at least two run samples;
multiple attempts within one run still contribute only one sample per key and
profile. Keys are pruned only when that profile has at least one observation in
each of at least three sampled runs, and only if the key is absent from every
contributing run. Profiles with fewer contributing runs retain all previous
keys; missing or unparseable logs do not count toward the threshold. Removals
remain explicit in the dry-run and PR change tables.
Samples above 2.5 times the key's median are discarded before taking the median,
and existing weights stay unchanged when the new median is within 15%. UI E2E
overhead is the median shard `(wall - body) / fileCount`, clamped to 0–5 seconds.

An empty `compactGroupSeconds.github` map is designed cold-start behavior:
main compact jobs normally run on Blacksmith, so the hosted profile keeps its
in-source `COMPACT_GITHUB_GROUP_SECONDS_HINTS` fallback until hosted observations
meet the sampling minimum. Later main attempts on the hybrid backend, or main
runs using `OPENCLAW_CI_RUNNER_BACKEND=github`, can fill it naturally. Once recorded,
hosted weights survive all-Blacksmith windows: pruning requires observations
from at least three hosted runs in the sampled window. Sampling stays main-only;
fork PR timings never influence the packer.

The `CI Test Timings Refit` workflow runs daily at 09:43 UTC and supports manual
dispatch on `main`. When weights change, it updates the single
`ci/test-timings-refit` branch and PR with sampled run IDs and the changed-entry
table. It never pushes to `main`; unchanged weights produce no commit or PR
update. The gitignored `.artifacts/vitest-shard-timings.json` remains a separate
whole-config timing cache for the local test-project runner, not an input to
these CI packers.

The shared generated-PR publisher refreshes `main` and rejects stale generator
inputs or overlapping timing-file changes before its leased branch push. It
uses separate repository-scoped GitHub App tokens for branch and PR writes;
the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` has only contents-read permission. App-created
events trigger CI without the `GITHUB_TOKEN`-specific workflow approval step.
Normal repository review and required checks still apply; this workflow does
not enable auto-merge. See
[GitHub's workflow-trigger rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow).

## Bounded hybrid hosted offload

Automatic canonical hybrid first attempts count the complete selected hosted inventory before adding short jobs: control and cache jobs, every selected check or Node matrix row, docs and i18n, performance, and hosted native jobs. Preflight records `hybrid_hosted_base_rows`, `hybrid_hosted_total_rows`, and `hybrid_hosted_offload`; the workflow guard independently expands the actual job gates, matrices, and runner expressions to verify the count. Eligible preflight runs on Blacksmith and is excluded from hosted rows; the performance row uses its canonical `run_control_ui_performance` owner.

`HYBRID_HOSTED_BASE_ROW_LIMIT` is 40 and `HYBRID_HOSTED_ROW_LIMIT` is 45. At or below 40 base hosted rows, preflight may move `security-fast`, the three `checks-ui` rows, and the browser-extension E2E row to hosted Ubuntu, adding at most five rows and never exceeding 45 through this admission. Above 40 base hosted rows, all five retain their existing Blacksmith routes. An eligible base above 45 emits a warning with the row count and retains the complete base manifest. The 45-row budget bounds optional offload admission; it does not reject existing coverage or reshape noneligible fallback manifests: retries, manual and frozen targets, untrusted authors, other repositories, and the `github` outage override retain their existing routing, including wholly hosted runs that can already exceed 45 rows.

No test inventory or worker budget changes. Control UI E2E shards, QA Smoke, real-Gateway checks, Android, and compiler-heavy jobs retain Blacksmith on eligible first attempts. Security now waits for preflight's decision; it still runs after a preflight failure unless the workflow was canceled. This exchanges parallel security startup for a complete hosted budget before runner allocation. Hosted assignment delay and ordinary cache setup can offset the compute saving, so compare the first exact-head run's hosted/Blacksmith row counts and queue times before widening the offload.
